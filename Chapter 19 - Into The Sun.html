I was to pick up my load in the morning and arrive 4 days later in Seattle Washington. At the time I had no idea what a gift such a long run like that is for a trucker. When your pick up and drop off times were days apart, that meant the schedule in-between was up to you. Normally these runs went to the more experienced truckers. Guys like me were sent to pick up recycled scrap metal in Detroit. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On this occasion however, my dispatcher was having a hard time finding someone who wanted to make the run. It sounded great to me, so I enthusiastically agreed and set of the next morning. This time 600 miles on day was actually not going to be a problem, since the largest city I&rsquo;d be driving through was Fargo North Dakota. It wasn&rsquo;t the traffic on this ride that would get to me though. The scenery through North Dakota is nothing more than the endless brownish green horizon under a vast fluffy cloud streaked sky. The freeway made no turns. There were no overpasses, or towns near the road. I heard nothing on the cb. I could count on my fingers the number of cars I saw driving across that whole state. As the day finally came to an end, I pulled into the Flying J truck stop at the edge of North Dakota in a town called &ldquo;Beach&rdquo;. I had to laugh at the name since the nearest significant beach was about 1000 miles from here. The landscape was starting to get hillier with some scattered trees, and I hoped that the drive tomorrow would be more interesting. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I would regret that wish. I was about to learn why the more experienced drivers were passing up the opportunity to make this run. The day started simple enough, I got dressed and pulled my truck up to the gas pumps. After starting the fillup, I went inside to grab a cup of coffee. In bigger cities I tried not to occupy the pumps for to long, but nobody was in a hurry here. A few minutes later the tanks would be full and I&rsquo;d be ready for a few more days of driving. I plotted out my course to Missoula Montana and left the state of North Dakota behind me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t notice the smoke for about an hour or two, but after it started it only got worse. It was obviously not fog, the color and odor gave it away. As my visibility plummeted, I reduced my speed an put my 4-ways on. Within an hour, I had my wipers on to clear away ash. I took my hoodie off and laid it over the vents. Off to the side of the road, I could see an eerie orange glow through the smoke. There hadn&rsquo;t been a place to turn off the road even safely stop for a few hundred miles. Finally I saw emergency lights ahead and thought I&rsquo;d be able to get some information or instruction on how to deal with this. But the source of the lights was just a couple of pickup trucks, and nobody was inside, so I just kept going. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I wasn&rsquo;t truly afraid until a gust of wind blew the smoke aside and I could see the forest. The field on both sides of the road had been reduced to a black patch of dirt and coals. Beyond that, the hills were pumping out massive clouds of choking black smoke. Behind the first few rows of scorched trees, an incredible wall of bright orange flames roared and surged with the wind. I considered turning around, but the road behind me was now completely obscured by fast moving smoke. The road ahead seemed to be the only way out. Incredibly, the next people I saw were pulled over on the eastbound lanes to take pictures. I guessed that they would&rsquo;ve stopped before now if the flames were any further west. I considered this a good sign and continued towards Missoula. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Missoula is not a big city, but it did have a decent truck stop. I easily found a parking spot and went inside for dinner. I vaguely remember wandering to an empty table but I have no idea if I ordered anything. The fires were all over the news, and the few other people that were in the restaurant never took their eyes of the television mounted in the corner. I watched in shock and awe as helicopters dropped buckets on the impossible inferno. Occasionally they&rsquo;d cut to an interview with some exhausted man with soot on his face wearing beat up outdoor gear who I assumed was some sort of fire authority. I&rsquo;m not sure how long i sat there before I got up and went back to my truck. I didn&rsquo;t speak to anyone in the lounge or on the cb. I wrote the actual time in my log book and fell fast asleep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
