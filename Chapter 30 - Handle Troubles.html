Salt trucks and plows had been out all night long, making sure the streets were clear but nothing was going to fix the temperature. Luckily I&rsquo;d left my truck running all night, so starting it wasn&rsquo;t going to be an issue. A blinking light on my dashboard computer let me know my dispatcher was already up. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Apparently, the load I was going to need that empty for was already gone. A new load was ready, right here in the yard. I went inside briefly to freshen up and grab a cup of coffee before hooking up to the trailer. It was easy enough to find, and looked in perfect shape. I backed my fifth wheel under the kingpin and hopped out to connect the air and electric lines. Out of habit, I pushed on the release handle to make sure my load was secure and heard it snap into place. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I couldn&rsquo;t believe that just happened. The handle should definitely not needed my help to snap into place, backing into the kingpin should&rsquo;ve done that already. This was absolutely a safety hazard. I hopped down from my rig and went to the garage to see if someone could look at it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; a tall skinny man with a ball cap said, &ldquo;pull into bay 3 and we&rsquo;ll have someone check it out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I unhooked the trailer and pulled my tractor into bay 3. I tried to find someone to explain what was going on, but the only 2 guys in the shop were clearly busy. I shut down the engine and went inside to watch the weather channel. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This was a pretty nice place to be stuck, if you had to be stuck somewhere. There was a comfortable lounge, clean showers, and this morning they had a breakfast buffet. I sat and ate pancakes while I watched the storm tracker and some coverage of a car accident on the freeway. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">About 2 and &frac12; &nbsp;hours later, someone finally came out from the garage to tell me what was going on with my truck.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We topped off your air pressure and filled up your washer fluid,&rdquo; the guy said, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that pull handle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Seriously,&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t believe it, &ldquo;nothing at all?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nope, you&rsquo;re in good shape.&rdquo; The guy smiled and handed me the keys. &nbsp;&ldquo;Your tractor is out front,&rdquo; he said and turned to walk back to the garage. As he opened the door I expected the cold outside air to rush in, but no air rushed in at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I walked over to the window in the door and looked into the garage. All the bay doors were shut. I opened the door to ask if I could talk to whoever looked at my truck and noticed the air was actually warm. The garage was heated. &nbsp;My truck had sat in a heated garage for hours before anyone looked at it. My faith that &ldquo;I was in good shape&rdquo; went right in the trash bin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I found my rig outside, still running, and backed up to my trailer once again. This time I triple checked the handle to make sure I was securely in place. Satisfied with the connection, I hopped back in the truck and planned my route. I was headed to the middle of nowhere, Illinois.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
