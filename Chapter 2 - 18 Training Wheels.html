They were desperate for drivers. They had trailers, customers and fully loaded semi-tractors ready and waiting - but nothing gets done without a human at the wheel. Any warm body with a minimal amount of training and the willingness to live on the road would do. The age limit and driving record notwithstanding of course. I had both and after 2 attempts at the written exam, I now had legal permission to apply for a commercial driving license. In exchange for 1 year of work without defecting to another trucking company, Schneider would finish my training and loan me a truck. I would be paid pennies-per-mile, but they add up when you&rsquo;re not paying rent. The training however, was more than I bargained for.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A typical semi trailer is 53 feet long and weighs over 40,000 pounds fully loaded. The training trailer was empty, and about a mile long. At least that&#39;s what it felt like. It was actually 48 feet long, but that first time you try and back up you realise just how much you need to learn. Many orange cones gave their lives so that the next generation of drivers could bring you your paper towels, gasoline, televisions, cars, aspirin, and pretty much every tangible thing you&rsquo;ve ever used or will use. At the end of the first week of training - they introduced us to the wet course. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If you&rsquo;ve ever lost control of your car, you know the fear that suddenly grips you when your tires lose their grip on the road. When you&rsquo;re connected to a massive weight carrying all the momentum of highway speed - slamming on the brakes can cause a sliding condition often referred to as the &ldquo;jack-knife&rdquo;. Imagine pushing a shoebox across the floor with a baseball bat. The box will want to turn sideways and resist the pushing of the bat. For a semi truck, the bat is the trailer and it will not give up. On the wet course, this scenario is triggered by an instructor sitting shotgun. They&rsquo;ve got a box on their lap with switches that can lock up any set of tires in the truck or the trailer no matter what speed you&rsquo;re driving at. Your goal is to reach the painted areas in the course without hitting the orange cones, and of course, to avoid the &ldquo;jack-knife&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I sat in the lunchroom waiting for my turn, a classmate turned to me and asked, &ldquo;You going out there today?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I nodded and watched another truck skidding around the edge of the lot.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; she said adding, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be that bad,&rdquo; I started to say, but never finished. Just then there was a terrible roaring sound and groaning of metal as the trailer behind the truck on the course took over. The helpless driver had completely missed the turn and the trailer was now swinging sideways around the bend. It whip snapped the cab violently and for a moment appeared as though it would completely sheer the cab off the tractor killing both the driver and trainer inside. At the last second, safety chains engaged with a sound like a car wreck and locked the trailer from bending any further. The session was over. The driver slowly climbed down from the rig and walked to the far side of the building instead of coming back into the lounge. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ohmygod!&rdquo; The student next to me exclaimed all in one word. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s insane! Do they make you quit when that happens?!?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Another student sat down at the table. &ldquo;They let you go to your car through the side entrance if you piss yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The room was silent for a moment.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah Reggie?&rdquo; a big guy laughed from the vending machines, &ldquo;how do you know that one?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone started laughing. Reggie turned red and left the room with his middle finger in the air.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My experience on the wet course was less dramatic. My run wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but thankfully I got a passing score on my first try. After that, I was assigned a mentor who would give us our first taste of real trucking. I was to arrive at 5 am starting the next monday, ready to drive. I didn&rsquo;t know where or with whom, but it was about to change everything I thought I knew about driving.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
