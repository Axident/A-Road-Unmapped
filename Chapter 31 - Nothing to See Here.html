It did nothing however, to fight the worst trick my mind had learned to play on the road: doubt. Was that load you just picked up properly balanced? Is that truck stop still ahead, or was it closed somewhere behind me? Or in this case, are these driving instructions accurate?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;d been driving for hours down an unlit county highway with no sign of life wondering if I&rsquo;d missed a turn when I finally saw some light ahead. It was a cop car with its turn signal on in front of a lonely farm house. There was a bright yard light in front of the house and I could see an officer standing next to the car by the road.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I let off the gas and slowed to a crawl with my 4 way lights on.
