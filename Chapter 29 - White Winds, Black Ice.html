The handoff location was a major center of operations for Schneider. It was easy to get to, the road was plowed and there were plenty of spaces for my trailer. I fueled up at the Schneider pump and went inside for a hot meal and a shower. By the time I came out, it had gotten dark and the snow storm had gotten worse. I trudged over some snow drifts on my way to my rig, where there was a message waiting for me from my dispatcher. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had a load ready for me in the morning, but I&rsquo;d need to go and fetch my own empty trailer from behind a nearby department store. I flipped over the cassette in my boombox and pushed in the air brake release. If I was going to get this trailer before I got snowed in, I&rsquo;d need to go right now.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Driving bobtail in a cabover style tractor like I was in meant that you&rsquo;d fit just inside the same space as any large SUV. The truck could just barely fit in a parking spot, corners could be made without swinging wide, but the best part was you could accelerate like a normal car. All the lower gears for building momentum while pulling a heavy load were useless. The rig could start right in 7th and pull away from a stoplight with a surprising amount of speed. Of course, this only works when you&rsquo;ve got enough traction to keep your tires from slipping. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I did not.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When enough snow and ice has been pounded into a slick glossy mirror across the road, you have an incredibly slippery glaze left on the asphalt often referred to as &ldquo;black ice&rdquo;. It blends in with the rest of the road and offers no traction whatsoever. A puck sliding across an air-hockey table has a better chance of slowing down or changing direction than a car driving on black ice. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The wet course training would come in handy tonight. On my first turn my drive tires slid sideways sending me on an awkward course through the empty intersection. I shoved in the clutch and let the wheels naturally settle to match the speed of the passing street below them. I maintained the aim of my steer tires at my intended direction, and when the drive tires connected with the road again I was on my way. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was much more careful at the next two intersections, but the long arc in the road leading to the department store took me by surprise. I felt the tires lose their grip, but this time the clutch trick had no effect. The steering wheel was also useless. I was sliding sideways on black ice at about 25 mph sitting on 9 tons of steel and diesel fuel. The road banked slightly as it rounded the bend, just enough to keep me on the road. I was separated from the oncoming lanes by a boulevard of bushes and streetlights clouded by steadily falling oversized snowflakes. I watched each pole and bush pass quietly to my left under the headlights of my truck as I slid the entire length of the block without hitting a thing. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I finally came to rest in the middle of the next intersection, facing exactly the direction I needed to continue. I looked both ways, shifted into a lower gear and slowly drove around the back of the store. The empty trailer was nowhere to be found.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I pulled into the parking lot and messaged my dispatcher, explaining that the trailer simply wasn&rsquo;t where it was supposed to be. It was a long time before another trailer number came up on my screen. By then there was just too much snow on the road to safely go hunting for a trailer. I sent another message saying that given the weather and driving conditions it just wasn&rsquo;t safe to continue. I released the brakes and carefully headed back to the Schneider lot. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
