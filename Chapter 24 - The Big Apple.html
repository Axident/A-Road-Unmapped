I got up after rush hour and enjoyed a slow breakfast. I plotted out my course, entered the time in my log and started up the engine. 90 minutes later, I was paying the $25 dollar toll to cross the George Washington bridge. I had been warned that this toll was coming - $5 per axle for my 5 axle rig.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">New York is a tricky city to drive a big truck in. The roads are tight and congested, the traffic will not yield adequate space, and driving for a well insured outfit like Schneider can be an added liability.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My drop off site was a small film studio at the end of a dead end street. I was warned not to drive right up to the address, as there wouldn&#39;t be anywhere for me to turn around. Instead I was to turn away from the location at the nearest intersection a block away, and proceed to backward some 2-3 hundred yards to their address. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Backing up into a parking spot with one of these things is an art form. Backing up for an entire New York city block full of parked cars was nothing short of black magic. Somehow I managed to reach my target without removing anyone&rsquo;s side mirrors. The studio was well versed in this routine and emptied the contents of the trailer with a couple of pallet jacks and a forklift in no time at all. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The hard part was getting back out of the city. I had an empty trailer now, but it wasn&rsquo;t any shorter. I soon found myself waiting through multiple cycles of the same green light for enough space to make my right turn through a busy intersection. Eventually, I started inching my way out into lanes to claim some space of my own. I could tell that as the light turned yellow, I&rsquo;d be able complete my turn. I&rsquo;d still be across 2 lanes of traffic, but at least I&rsquo;d have secured the space I&rsquo;d need to continue. As the light changed, a small white car darted through the intersection from the oncoming direction and turned right in front of me. They were so close, I couldn&rsquo;t even see the vehicle without standing up. When the cars in front of them moved, I waited to see where they would go - but they didn&rsquo;t move. They put on their hazard lights and got out of the car. I put on my 4-ways and climbed down from the cab. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you crazy,&rdquo; the a black haired man in a white T-shirt was yelling, &ldquo;you hit my car!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo; I was shocked, there&rsquo;s no way we made contact. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right there,&rdquo; he pointed to a small scuff on the corner of his bumper.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The light had changed at this point and cars were beginning to honk.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that was me, guy.&rdquo; I tried to explain, &ldquo;My bumper is higher than that and there&rsquo;s no mark on my truck.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Car horns were getting more persistent.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not making this up!&rdquo; he continued yelling, &ldquo;You give me your insurance information!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;d heard stories about this kind of thing. Big truck companies have deep pockets and typically pay out for these kinds of claims. &ldquo;Ok, let&#39;s get out of the way first.&rdquo; I motioned to the right side of the road at the end of the block. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pull over behind you over there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, ok&rdquo; he stormed back to his car and pulled up.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I got back in my truck and moved forward enough to allow traffic around me. I waited as a wall of cars lined up between me and where I told him to park. I watched for the next left arrow to light up and drove away from the madness. I took the next onramp and settled into traffic. I never saw that guy again.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
