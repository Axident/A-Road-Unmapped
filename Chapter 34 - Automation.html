His truck was warm and clean, but just as old and worn as mine. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The trailers we&rsquo;ll use look just like normal trailers on the outside, but they&rsquo;re specially designed for this job,&rdquo; he explained as he drove us around to where they were kept.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So nobody else takes these?&rdquo; I knew how valuable empty trailers were.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re useless to anyone else,&rdquo; he said swinging the doors open to show me, &ldquo;check this out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The entire interior was reinforced with wheeled racks and motorized conveyor belts. There was no place for a standard pallet, steel drums or any other typical shipping containers. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is all this stuff?&rdquo; I&rsquo;d never seen anything like it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all part of an assembly line. We&rsquo;re part of a mostly automatic system that builds Ford pickup trucks.&rdquo; He pointed to some of the working parts at the end of the trailer, &ldquo;This connects to the end of a plant where they build the seats. We drive those seats to another factory where they&rsquo;re automatically unloaded and installed in the vehicles.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you kidding me?&rdquo; I had no idea what I&rsquo;d gotten into.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait &lsquo;till you see the factory,&rdquo; Steve continued as we pulled out onto the road, &ldquo;it&#39;s more machines than people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The first factory or the second?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well the seat assembly plant has a major manual component to it, maybe that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s in Wisconsin.&rdquo; He checked his mirrors and signaled his next turn. &ldquo;The truck factory is all robots and shit.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we got to the seat factory, I could tell why this part was done by hand. As the metal framework of the seats came down the line, a human was needed to pull the padding in place. It took a bit of tugging and pushing to get it to sit just right. Once the cushion was on, a cover had to be pulled over the whole thing. The cushion needed to be massaged into place so that the cover was filled and shaped like a seat. From there a machine cinched the edges and sewed the whole thing up. After this step the seat was folded by another machine, and put into a staging area where it waited for us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We backed our trailer up to the specialized dock and a spring loaded mechanism brought the loading stage to life. The seats were automatically organized and raised into chutes that connected directly to the conveyor belts in the trailer. Then hydraulic arms lifted the whole thing to the next level and filled the top rows. Once it completed the loading routine, the stage was reset and began collecting the new seats as fast as people could complete them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no paperwork to sign, no foreman to talk to, no human interaction at all. We just closed the doors and drove off to the next site. It was less than an hour drive back to Minnesota to the Ford truck factory.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Normally, you just back up to the loading dock and everything is pulled out automatically.&rdquo; Steve said as he put on the brakes at the unloading door. &ldquo;But if something goes wrong, that light turns red and you&rsquo;ll need to go inside.&rdquo; He pointed at a signal next to the dock that could be seen in the side view mirror of the truck. It was clear that when everything was working as expected, the only thing we were needed for was to open and close the trailer doors on either end of driving over the state line.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow, good thing robots can&rsquo;t drive or they wouldn&rsquo;t need us at all!&rdquo; I joked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Think they can&rsquo;t?&rdquo; He asked me as he punched a 4 digit security code into the pad by the door. &ldquo;Check this out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This factory was very different than the other one. It was dimly lit and a faint smell of grease hung in the still air. A persistent white noise of metal wheels and machines seemed to come from everywhere, only broken by occasional beeps and buzzes of what I assumed were warnings to any humans that might get in the way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The inside of the loading dock had a mechanism similar to the loading system I&rsquo;d just seen. From here you could watch the belts and hydraulic arms pull every last seat out of the trailer and stage them for whatever was around the corner.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sometimes the belts don&rsquo;t line up exactly and you need to jostle this handle.&rdquo; Steve pointed to a large metal pipe with red tape on the end sticking out of the side of the frame. &ldquo;If that doesn&rsquo;t work, you can try and reset it.&rdquo; He pointed to a large yellow control box at the end of the row with red and green buttons on it. &ldquo;You just turn it off and back on again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And that fixes it?&rdquo; It seemed simple enough.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Almost always,&rdquo; he shrugged, &ldquo;if not, you&rsquo;ll need to find someone on the floor. Come on, I&rsquo;ll introduce you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The deeper we went into the factory, the less friendly to humans it seemed. There were dusty caution signs on everything. Most of the floor looked like nobody had ever walked on it. The rest had brightly colored paint lines like a metro rail map running in every direction. &ldquo;What are those lines for?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Here comes one,&rdquo; he moved me aside before any further explanation was needed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A small forklift like machine came cruising past with several large crates in it&rsquo;s front arms. Behind it was a short series of flat carts all attached like a train with boxes of their own. A yellow flashing light spun on of a pole attached where a seat might have been if it needed a driver. But there was no driver, it just followed the green line around the corner and out of sight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That would&rsquo;ve stopped before running us over right?&rdquo; I assumed there was some safety protocol.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Supposedly,&rdquo; he shrugged and then tossed me a serious look, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t test that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We looked around for another minute, but didn&rsquo;t see anyone for Steve to introduce me to. It seemed unnecessary anyway, it was clear that this was not a job where I&rsquo;d need to know a lot of people. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
