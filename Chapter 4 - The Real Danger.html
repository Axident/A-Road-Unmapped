On her last day, the afternoon drive was long and challenging. The way the shift trading worked, I ended up doing the lion&rsquo;s share of the work that day. Alice had driven us to the pickup location: a pill factory that I first thought must be some sort of prison or military warehouse. The loading dock was guarded by men in bullet proof vests carrying shotguns. The parking lot was surrounded by 20 foot cement walls topped with razor wire. Nick took care of the paperwork, but the drive home was my job.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When you&rsquo;ve just picked up a load of pharmaceuticals you can&rsquo;t just drive back to any old parking lot with it. Certain loads are presumed valuable regardless of what you may or may not be carrying. There are stories of trailers being raided after leaving places with contents that can be resold on the street at significant profit. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you actually picked up, you&rsquo;re potentially in danger by virtue of having left a yard that ships these things. On this day we had such a load, and it needed to be delivered to the next driver tonight. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nick was visibly nervous as we drove through the city. He checked the mirrors the whole time we waited at every red light. &ldquo;Try and time the lights so we don&rsquo;t have to stop.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you actually worried someone will break into our trailer while we wait for the signal to change?&rdquo; I tried to ask lightly, as though this were a ridiculous question.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time.&rdquo; Nick said flatly.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I started paying more attention to my surroundings at that point. Everything started to look suspicious. A car double parked in the road made me slow down and change landes. Nick looked relieved that I was able to avoid stopping. Not much further down the road, traffic was completely stopped through the intersection.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; Nick checked the map, &ldquo;turn right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next few turns were a bit hairy, as they were not roads designed to accommodate such a large truck. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Drive down the middle when you can, I don&rsquo;t want to lose any paint in here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do we do if I break of somebody&rsquo;s mirror?&rdquo; I asked as we barely fit around the next bend.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Nick double checked the map, &ldquo;turn here, then it&#39;s just a few blocks to the freeway.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was tight but we squeaked through the neighborhood and onto the freeway. We&rsquo;d drive another hour or so before any of us started to relax. Nick told us about a friend of his who got mugged carrying a load like this. He recited the company policy about doing anything you were asked, your life isn&rsquo;t worth the price of any load and so on. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was still giving me advice in between turn-by-turn directions when it happened. The sun had been down for a few hours and Chicago was far behind us. I&rsquo;d all but forgotten about our cargo.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This road will take us right behind the distribution center,&rdquo; he said pointing out my next turn.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We pulled up behind some other trucks who were making similar drop-offs. When your trucking outfit was as big as the one we worked for - important loads didn&rsquo;t have to stop. You would stop at a center like the one we were pulling into and your load would get hauled out by another driver within minutes. There were several trucks pulling in at this hour and we soon found ourselves waiting in line. One or two trucks would turn left across a break in traffic, and the rest of us would inch up like a giant caterpillar. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was stopped for at least a 2 or 3 full minutes before I saw an opportunity to make my turn. I put the truck in gear, turned the wheel hard left and slowly raised my foot of the clutch. We began to roll forward and just as I added some gas to give us the acceleration we&rsquo;d need to cross the road, Nick yelled &ldquo;STOP!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I traded the gas pedal for the brake in an instant and pushed down with my full strength. The sudden shift in momentum caused all 18 truck tires to bark as they skid under our weight. I felt my seatbelt yank hard into my shoulder as Nick&rsquo;s arms shot out to catch a driver&rsquo;s ledger that came flying off the console between us. Poor Alice had been asleep on the upper bunk, but suddenly found herself tossed to the floor with a crash. &ldquo;Oh my god, what the hell?&rdquo; she yelled.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo; Nick took off his seatbelt and helped Alice up.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she seemed more upset than anything. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How about you?&rdquo; He was looking at me now.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; I said, more scared than hurt, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the problem?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Did you forget how long your trailer is?&rdquo; Nick was looking at me incredulously. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, no?&rdquo; I was trying to make sense of the situation, &ldquo;what are you talking about?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Roll down your window and look back at the turn lane, did we hit the sign yet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Out my window I could see a &ldquo;Keep Right&rdquo; sign sticking out of the curb facing the oncoming traffic. If I&rsquo;d have driven another 5 feet my trailer would have effortlessly jumped the curb and folded that sign to the ground. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh god, I didn&rsquo;t realize...&rdquo; I sighed before answering his question, &ldquo;almost, but no, we&rsquo;re good.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; Nick apologized, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have kept you driving so long today. Swap seats, I&rsquo;ll take it from here.&rdquo; Grabbing the wheel and leaning out the window, Nick deftly backed us up and swerved around the sign. He finished our delivery without another mention of it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
