Michelle was a million times better company than the CB radio or my heavy metal mix tapes. I&rsquo;d call from truck stop lounges, resting in my cab, or just shoot the breeze on my way down the road. It was incredible; &nbsp;I now had someone with whom I could share the experience of this job and its endless parade of dangers, spectacles, strange customers and occasional mystery.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">One night we finished talking after dinner, but I still had some miles to go before I could park. I let her go and turned on the CB radio. I was met with silence. I flipped the tape in my boombox and started humming the first tune before it began. I had listened to this tape too many times. I turned it off and rolled down the window to listen to the road. A semi truck makes a comfortable hum at 65 miles per hour. Aside from the occasional sudden blast of hissing air from the air compressor, the sound of your tires on the road and the steady monotone song of the massive engine make for a hypnotic backdrop to the repeating dotted line passing on your left. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The cool night air felt good on my face and arm as I pushed on into the darkness. I knew the danger of getting sleepy under these conditions so I started making up a science fiction story in my head as I drove. I came up with some characters I liked and an adventure for them to have when I noticed the shoulders of the road were gone. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Instead of the normal black margin on either side of the freeway, there were low concrete walls. I was on a bridge. This was nothing new, I had been on bridges before but this was different. I couldn&rsquo;t see the far end of the bridge, nor could I tell where it began looking behind me in the mirrors. It seemed to go on forever, with no visible means of support. I could see nothing on either side - just the inky blackness of undeveloped countryside at night. With the exception of the short distance of light my high beams cast in front of me, there wasn&rsquo;t any sign of the world around me at all. It felt like more than a full minute passed before the bridge finally landed on the side of a hill and the road returned to normal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">I wanted more than anything to hear someone on the CB. Not just for confirmation that I was still awake, but to find out where the heck I was. It would be another hour before I finally got to the truck stop I had planned on reaching. I backed my trailer into a reasonable spot and pulled out my trucker&rsquo;s atlas to find out what bridge I had just been over. What I discovered, I&rsquo;ve never told anyone until now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">There was no bridge on that road.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
