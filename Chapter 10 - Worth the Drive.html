My roommate Tim and I were supposed to be splitting everything 50/50 but he&rsquo;d been out of work for a few weeks and need me to pay the full cost this month. We had recently both recently decided to quit drinking and the choice made us instant friends. The kind of bond I suppose people have when they&rsquo;ve survived some sort of tragedy. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I wasn&rsquo;t about to put him in a harder spot than he already was. Money had been tight for both of us before I got the Scheider gig. He felt pretty bad about the situation and offered to install a mind blowing stereo in my car in exchange for his half of the rent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What are you doing with all this stereo equipment?&rdquo; I asked when he first proposed the idea, showing me what he&rsquo;d collected in the garage.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I pulled it from my old car before I sold it,&rdquo; he explained.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Inside I knew this was a lie. I met Tim after he&rsquo;d sold his car, and this pile of equipment wasn&rsquo;t here 2 weeks ago. But I had to admit that a kickin&rsquo; stereo would really make my Beretta the car I wanted it to be. Plus I had a road trip to make this weekend. As we put the final screws in place to remount the dashboard I asked him, &ldquo;What are you doing tomorrow?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No plans, why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I got a wedding invitation in Minnesota,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;an old high-school buddy.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it!&rdquo; he said with surprising enthusiasm. &ldquo;Now let&#39;s try this thing out. Gimme that case of CDs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tim had a great music collection. All the way to Minnesota we blasted the CD player so loud it shook the mirrors. We stopped for lunch and still covered the route from Green Bay to Stillwater in just over 3 hours. Later I&rsquo;d do the math and realize that our average speed would&rsquo;ve been about 90 mph. But everything came to a stop when I saw her at the reception.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You know that moment, when time slows and your heartbeat replaces all the sounds in the room? Followed by that moment when you realise you&rsquo;ve been staring and you quick check the people next to you to see if they noticed you. I didn&rsquo;t have the nerve to go ask her to dance, and I thought I saw that she was with someone. So this would not be my moment. Tim on the other hand was off having a blast with my high-school friend&#39;s younger sister. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He was pretty quiet about it the whole ride home, and I was lost in my own thoughts. I&rsquo;d gotten pretty good about keeping my mind occupied while I drove. The Matrix still haunted me and made me wonder what it took to make a movie like that. How is it possible to film things that don&rsquo;t exist? I knew computers and special effects were involved but I had to know more. Somehow people were getting trained for this. Perhaps I could make enough money driving truck to afford to go back to school.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
