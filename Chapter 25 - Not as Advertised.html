I pulled up with an empty trailer and a big grin. I knew what I was bringing would be valuable to someone waiting here. Besides drivers, the thing that big trucking outfits never have enough of is empty trailers. Too often a load will be ready for pick up and a driver will be available for the job; but without an empty trailer, time and money start slipping away while the shipment sits idle on the dock. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I parked the empty in the first open spot and went inside to talk to my dispatcher. Before he assigned me my next load, I had an important question for him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is there any way I could get a load to St. Paul?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can only have one home city,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it can be any city in America. Do you want it to be St. Paul?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; I knew I&rsquo;d be giving up free meals and laundry in Green Bay, but I had a good feeling about this. &ldquo;Yes, let&#39;s make it St. Paul.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Done. You&rsquo;re next load is at your location and due in St. Paul 2 and &frac12; days from now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hung up and went back to my cab to wait for the dashboard computer to light up with details. While I waited I plotted out my course. If I fudged the numbers a bit, I could be in St. Paul in 2 days, giving me a 3 day weekend with Michelle. I called her and gave her the good news. We made some plans as my trailer number and delivery location popped up on my computer for me to accept. I quickly said good night and confirmed the appointment. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unfortunately, if I forced this journey into a 2 day ride - my overnight tomorrow was in the middle of nowhere. It had already been 2 days since I&rsquo;d had a chance to shower and 2 more days was not going to make me a welcome guest at Michelle&#39;s. The place I was at listed a shower as one of it&rsquo;s amenities. I grabbed my shower kit and a clean set of clothes and went inside. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, where&rsquo;s the showers?&rdquo; I asked the guy at the desk.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What showers?&rdquo; He said without looking up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you guys have showers? This listing says there are showers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We used to have showers,&rdquo; he said finally pulling his eyes up from his book. &ldquo;Now we have a closet with a floor drain.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?!? No, come on,&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. &ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry kid. No laundry, no towels, just a shower head sticking out of the wall in that little room back there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I gotta have a shower,&rdquo; I tried to explain, &ldquo;I&rdquo;m meeting a girl in 2 days and this is the last place I&rsquo;m going to have a chance to take one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hot water, no shower curtain, no towels or even a place to hang a towel.&rdquo; He started, but could tell I was desperate, &ldquo;but the room is all yours if you want it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The room was as bare as he described it: it didn&rsquo;t even have a door. I tried to pile my things where they might not get soaked and took the coldest shower imaginable. Without any towel, I just brushed the water off my arms and body with swift strokes of my hands and forced my clothes on over my wet skin. I had to use the side view mirror in my truck to brush my hair, but when it was over I was relatively presentable. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now to find my trailer. The computer had spit out my destination and directions accurately enough, but the trailer number listed for this trip was not parked with the rest. I had to go back inside for clarification.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s out there kid,&rdquo; the man at the front desk assured me, &ldquo;look again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I already triple checked, that trailer number is not in your yard.&rdquo; I repeated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It has to be,&rdquo; he said paging through listings on his computer, &ldquo;The computer has shows it arrived 2 days ago.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can you show me where it&rsquo;s parked?&rdquo; I tried to sound like I believed him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a heavy sigh, the man stood up and put on a jacket. We walked up and down the rows of trailers looking for something that matched the information on his clipboard. After some time we stopped in front of a trailer with a different number on it. &ldquo;This must be it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That number doesn&rsquo;t match my instructions.&rdquo; I pointed out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, but it doesn&rsquo;t match my records either,&rdquo; he paged through his clipboard. &ldquo;This trailer isn&rsquo;t supposed to be here,&rdquo; he muttered and walked around to the doors in back. I followed him as he did a light inspection and checked the plastic seal on the lock. &ldquo;The seal is still good, someone is expecting this delivery.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And you think they just got the trailer numbers mixed up?&rdquo; I wanted to believe that was true, but mostly I just wanted a load to Minnesota.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s happened before,&rdquo; he made a note as he asked, &ldquo;You want it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded and signed the form.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
