Sometimes you can&#39;t avoid paying a toll, and Schneider will reimburse you for those runs. But since there&rsquo;s an alternate route through Ohio, the choice is yours and so is the cost. I always took the scenic route. It was mostly a long straight band of asphalt through small farming communities with little interruption. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is in this part of the world where a large number of Amish families have chosen to make their home. The Amish reject the modern conveniences of technology like cell phones and farm tractors. They do all of their labor by hand and live in peaceful little communities dotted along this road. The only time this is an issue for me, is when they need to travel a significant distance.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since they don&rsquo;t use motorized vehicles, the Amish will pull a horse drawn cart right out onto the highway. They will place a reflective triangle on the back of their cart, perhaps out of legal obligation or just common sense, and make their way down the road at an agonizing 10 - 15 mph. Most people drive faster than this in parking lots. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s a fairly uncommon sight, but having one of these carts in front of you when you&rsquo;d rather be getting paid at 4 time this rate it&rsquo;s pretty frustrating. I give them plenty of room and try to wait for an opportunity to pass, but how much room is enough? And how much space would I need to get up to speed, cross over into oncoming lanes and get all 53 feet of my trailer in front of the horse before I started coming back over? </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On a long straight stretch of highway like this, you could see oncoming cars for many miles. If I waited until I couldn&rsquo;t see anything coming my way, passing would never be an option. Luckily, this would not be necessary. I&rsquo;d accelerated with this much weight enough to be able to imagine each step in real time.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I counted it out in my head as I imagined the sluggish response from stepping on the gas. I accounted for a gear shift adding another 2 seconds. I added a few more for the actual passing of the cart. I padded a few more on the end to get in front of him. Just to be safe I rounded the whole thing up to 20 seconds. Now all I needed was to pick an oncoming car and count how far it travelled in 20 seconds to see how far away that was. I watched as a pickup truck passed a silo some distance away and began to count.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It turned out to be a good span of road, but still well within the distance I could see from up here. This meant that I&rsquo;d be pulling out across the center line and willfully aiming my truck head on with a car I could see coming toward me at 65+ mph. It was not an easy choice to make. I picked a likely opportunity and pretended to make my move. I counted out the seconds and imagined each step of the maneuver. In my head I was well back on my side of the road before the car was even close.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I did this twice more before I finally had the nerve to hit the gas. From this slow speed, accelerating faster than a horse drawn cart didn&rsquo;t take much effort. I was committed and passing the horse in seconds. The oncoming speck of a car began to take shape. The horse was now visible through the low window on the passenger side of my truck. I shifted gears. The approaching car was now clearly visible, the horse was not. I could only see it in the round warped mirror on the side of my cab. It was difficult at best to gauge how far away it was at this point. I&rsquo;d passed cars enough to have a sense of where they needed to be for me to change lanes, and it seemed good enough at this point. The car coming at me flashed his headlights, but he was still a safe distance away. I pulled back into my lane, and a few seconds later the car passed without issue. It was few seconds before the cart was far enough behind me that I could see he was ok in my side view mirrors. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought to myself, &ldquo;Maybe next time I&rsquo;ll just pay the toll.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
