Soon another, then another. I felt obligated to add mine and flipped the switch on my dashboard. Now the row between our trucks was lit up like a sports arena, and the figure in question was shielding their eyes and waving down our lights. Next to them a small dog came out from peeing on the tires and stood close to the man&#39;s legs. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Shit its just Eddie and his dog,&rdquo; the guy apologised and lights began turning off. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As each truck turned off their headlights some of them left on their amber parking lights. It was a nice orange glow, and I thought I&rsquo;d do the same. After a few minutes there was a knock on my door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This was very unusual. in fact, nobody had ever knocked on my door before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I rolled down my window and looked down to see a young woman in a skirt and unzipped hoodie. She was not wearing a shirt. &ldquo;Whatcha in the mood for tonight, sweetheart,&rdquo; she asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You lookin for a date or not?&rdquo; She was clearly disappointed in my confusion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Uh no,&rdquo; I felt terribly awkward, &ldquo;no thanks&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then loose the lights asshole,&rdquo; she spun on her heels and walked to the next lit truck. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I watched in a bit of shock as she climbed into someone else&#39;s truck and the lights went off. Scanning the parking lot, I could see 2 other underdressed women who apparently worked this lot. At breakfast the next morning I would learn the term was &ldquo;lot lizard.&rdquo; This was not the last time I&rsquo;d see this, but it was the last time I left my amber lights on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
