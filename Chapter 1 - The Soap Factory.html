The freeway had become a stagnant line of frozen cars, idling in the winter afternoon sun. My father and I stared in silence at the row of frustrated drivers all waiting to merge in front of us as we listened to classic rock on the old FM radio and pretended not to be bothered by the traffic. I can remember looking out the window at a poorly snow-plowed stretch of asphalt that turned away from the frontage road next to us and wound off into the distance. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Where does that road go?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, that road?&rdquo; he leaned forward to see past where I was looking, &ldquo;nowhere.&rdquo; he shrugged.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It must go somewhere,&rdquo; I insisted, &ldquo;why else would they plow it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he put his blinker on and prepared to change lanes, &ldquo; I mean it goes somewhere, just nowhere important.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But like on a map,&rdquo; I imagined, &ldquo;we could look it up later and see what you would find if you drove down there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes son,&rdquo; he sometimes spoke this way that carried more meaning than you might realize in the moment, &ldquo;you could look it up on a map. That would tell you what&rsquo;s on the road, but not what you&rsquo;d find by taking it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I thought, maybe I&rsquo;d take it someday to see what he meant. I&rsquo;d take them all, one of them had to be better than this.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">----------</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The days and years that followed this conversation took me all over Wisconsin and Minnesota, but not where I needed to be. I spent some time pursuing the wrong major for a few years at the University. I loved and lost. I found work at the most unlikely places. I lost myself and walked the streets. I won cars and cash and good friends. I dismissed them all and tried reinventing myself in new towns. I drove shuttle vans, washed dishes, delivered pizza, prepared food as a prep cook, parked cars, and sold vacuums over the phone. Eventually I learned how to make soap. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soap is a dangerous product to make. The soap I learned to make was intended for automatic touchless car wash tunnels. The idea was that the machines would spray the stuff on your car and wait for it to eat away at the surface dirt and road salt. Then, just before it started eating into the enamel of your car&rsquo;s paint - water jets would blast the stuff down the drain leaving your car shiny and new. The chemicals required for the job would be mixed at a ratio including a tiny amount of product, and a large amount of water. So you can imagine how incredibly toxic the concentrated stuff was. That was what we made. 30 and 55 gallon drums of skin-melting, bubble-gum-smelling, car-polishing acid with names like &ldquo;Lustrafoam&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Dynashield&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After months of operating the drum cleaning equipment, then working as a line operator, I was finally promoted to shipping. It was during my second week driving fork-lift when it happened. The semi-trailer was backed into the dock and waiting for us to finish unloading the raw chemicals. I had just finished putting away a pallet of sulfuric acid in the hazmat bay and was returning for the last pallet in the front of the trailer when I learned that not all pallets are the same size. Some pallets are only half as wide as a normal pallet, so when you slide the forks under one of these pallets you stick out of the other side. In my case, that meant the tip of my fork made a sickening &ldquo;thunk&rdquo; of a sound when it punctured the barrel of acetone on the other side of the pallet I was grabbing. I didn&rsquo;t realize what I&rsquo;d done until I backed down the trailer followed by the most intensely shocking rubbing alcohol smells you can imagine. The floor supervizor jumped up from his paperwork, &ldquo;What the hell happened?&rdquo; he yelled.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think I ruptured a drum of something,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;should I pull it out?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Get out of there!&rdquo; He yelled and pulled a mask over his face.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One thing I learned working at this factory: if other people are mixing, pouring or doing anything that requires them to wear masks - you want one too. In this case, it was clear that I should just keep driving. After a few minutes we were told it was all clear and we could re-load the trailer with new finished product. The driver watched to make sure nothing else went wrong.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about the mess I made&rdquo; I stopped my lift near him to apologize.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; he shrugged, &ldquo;not my drum.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry if I messed up your trailer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not my trailer,&rdquo; he smirked, &ldquo;not my truck, not my problem. I just drive.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; I had no idea that&rsquo;s how it worked.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Really.&rdquo; He nodded at my fork-lift, &ldquo;The pay is way better than drivin&rsquo; that too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The wheels had already started turning in my head, &ldquo;How do you get a job driving truck?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re at least 25 with a clean driver&rsquo;s license, they&rsquo;ll hire any walk-on at Schneider down the road.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Later that week I put in my two-weeks notice at the soap factory.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
