The time went by all too quickly, and at the end of it they handed me my own set of keys.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was now in charge of my own hours; as long as I made my deliveries and pickups on time. I&rsquo;d be given orders on a simple computer monitor attached to my dashboard, complete with an address, some simple turn by turn instructions, and a trailer number. This was before smartphones or computerized maps. If I needed more information, I&rsquo;d be looking at a trucker&rsquo;s atlas: basically a giant map book of all the trucking routes in North America. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I shook hands with my dispatcher, a bearded red-headed man who I&rsquo;d never see face to face again. He unceremoniously introduced himself and told me where I could find the truck where I&rsquo;d be spending the next 365 days according to my contract. After this time, I&rsquo;d be free to pursue a trucking career with any other carrier and my school debt would be considered paid. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The truck they loaned me was an International Cabover, similar to the one Nick trained me on. Mine was not nearly so nice. The console between the seats was raised and had to be climbed over to reach the back. The back was unfinished, without any of the amenities Nick and added to his own rig. It had room to sit, sleep and eat, and could pull a house off its foundation. I was home.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My first order of business was to collect some basic necessities. I bought a cheap mattress, an electric blanket and a power converter to plug it in. I grabbed my sleeping bag, a few weeks worth of clothes, my cds and an ground-shaking boombox. I was to take my first load to Chattanooga Tennessee - paper. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I mapped out my route so that I&rsquo;d land at my destination within an hour of my scheduled delivery time. I figured that since I was limited by law to a 10 hour work day, that my first day should include about 600 miles. That meant I&rsquo;d need to average about 60 miles per hour for the whole trip, which seemed reasonable since almost the entire route was on the freeway. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I was wrong.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I sailed through Milwaukee right on schedule, feeling pretty good about my plan. Everything changed when I got to Chicago. I&rsquo;d been here before, so I thought this would be just like any other trip I&rsquo;d taken down here. On this day, an accident had shut down two lanes of traffic causing miles and miles of backed up traffic. I had my music going and and no need to exit, so I just kept inching forward.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After some time, I noticed the truck driver next to me was trying to get my attention. He was talking into his cb radio and pointing to mine. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s a strange sensation when you pull up next to another semi in traffic. All the regular sized cars that truckers call &ldquo;4 wheelers&rdquo; seem like cattle, and we&rsquo;re the cowboys on horseback. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I flicked on the power button on my cb and my ears were immediately met with a shocking stream of casual profanity and laughter. It wasn&rsquo;t obvious at first who was talking to who. It was like standing in front of 10 televisions at the same volume in a department store and trying to figure out which sounds belonged to which picture. A voice among the rest was saying, &ldquo;Hey there Schneider, you got your ears on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Schneider was written in large black letters down the side of my giant bright orange trailer. Until I told anyone otherwise Schneider wasn&rsquo;t just the carrier I worked for, it was my name. I cautiously pressed the talk button and answered, &ldquo;Uh, yeah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey northbound, how much longer are we gonna be stuck in this shit?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I was hearing other truckers and still not sure how to tell who I was talking to. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The driver next to me ignored it and continued, &ldquo;Get outta that fuckin&rsquo; lane or you&rsquo;re gonna be stuck in it for the rest of your mornin.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Bout 3 more miles,&rdquo; a random driver called out, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re clear after about 35th street.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s easy to see a pretty good distance ahead over all the shorter vehicles stuck in traffic. From this vantage point, it was clear what the driver was trying to save me from. Once cars got in a bad lane closure like this, forcing your way over would be extremely difficult. I put on my left blinker and started to look for an opening. It looked like it might already be too late.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Damn it Schneider, you&rsquo;ll never get in like that&rdquo;, the other driver started to brake, &ldquo;here, take this lane while you can.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I pulled over in front of the huge blue truck slowing to allow me some room. &ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; I said into the cb as soon as I finished my lane change.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Aww, Bearclaw&rsquo;s got a friend!&rdquo; rang out on the radio followed by a lot of anonymous laughter from nearby trucks.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fuck you guys, we all had a first load once,&rdquo; a voice snapped back apparently from the man who just let me in.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know it was my first run?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you fuckin&rsquo; kidding me?&rdquo; someone called back, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s really you&rsquo;re first run?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Over the next hour the other truckers would share first run stories as they joined and left the local range of our conversation. I would learn that this is how truckers fight the loneliness. A strange sort of group therapy created by sharing stories with complete strangers in an environment without any lasting consequence or accountability. Somewhere in-between the filthy language, abject racism, and general overuse of trucker jargon, there were moments where someone might actually say something helpful.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The chatter would continue for some miles before it faded and eventually disappeared altogether. The silence was soon interrupted by an advertisement occasionally repeating over the common channel. I was apparently approaching a truck stop with discounts offered to anyone with a commercial driver&rsquo;s license. I was feeling pretty hungry, and this seemed like a good time to stop.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It wasn&rsquo;t the most classy of joints, but the parking lot was clearly wide enough for semi trucks. I definitely didn&rsquo;t want to spend my first and only time off the main road wedged into a space too small for big trucks. I didn&rsquo;t need gas, and wouldn&#39;t for another day or 2, so I rolled past the pumps and put on my brakes next to the other trucks in the large gravel area behind the restaurant. I shut down my rig and went inside.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The smell of fried food and stale cigar smoke washed over me as I passed through the double glass doors and walked past the &ldquo;seat yourself&rdquo; sign. I didn&rsquo;t feel like I needed a whole table to myself so I grabbed a bar stool at the counter. The place was surprisingly busy and it would be a few minutes before anyone asked for my order. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That yer pumpkin out there?&rdquo; A rough looking guy asked me nodding sideways at my big orange trailer visible through the side windows.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; I corrected myself, &ldquo;well it&#39;s a loaner for now. I just started with Schneider.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; his wide grin taking the edge off his thick sarcasm. &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Chattanooga, but I&rsquo;m already off schedule.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No yer not.&rdquo; he said taking a long sip of coffee.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well Chicago took way more out of my day than I was - &ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No it didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He put his mug down. &ldquo;It took exactly as long as you thought, and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going to put in your log.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I only answered with a puzzled look.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What can I getcha driver?&rdquo; A grey haired woman with a raspy voice and dirty apron was asking me.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to look at the menu&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You look like you need a burger and fries,&rdquo; she said writing down my order before I even answered. She looked up at me over her glasses to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t going to protest and turned to walk away. She stopped suddenly to look up at a T.V. monitor that started covering lottery numbers. She took out a ticket from her pocket, unfolded and folded it repeatedly in her hand as the man on the screen explained how much the jackpot was going up to. She put it away as the next commercial started.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Playing the numbers again, Audrey?&rdquo; A man two tables away called out.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You betcher ass!&rdquo; She turned to face the room.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Whadder you gonna do if yah win?&rdquo; He continued.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure as hell gonna quit this gig, that&rsquo;s fer sure.&rdquo; She put her pen behind her ear and started around the counter. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Audrey,&rdquo; he paused for impact, &ldquo;I hope you win.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The room erupted with laughter while the guy next to me leaned over to explain his earlier comments. The banter between the other patrons and the waitstaff fell to the background as he motioned to the room full of truckers who&rsquo;d all taken their lunch here. None of us were about to write down that we just spent over 2 hours driving through that mess in Chicago. We all spent the normal time driving, and then took a long lunch; at least that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;d put in our log books. That way we still have the rest of our legally allowed hours to put some miles behind us before we were obligated by law to stop for the day. And if anyone checked our log books at a weigh station, they&rsquo;d only see the hours we wanted them to see. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This put me back on schedule, and allowed me to continue driving the rest of the distance I&rsquo;d planned on for the day. I thanked him for his advice, paid for my burger, and went to my truck to join the biggest and most common lie in the industry. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The drive so far had taken me over 6 hours, but I needed to go another 5 today. I plotted out the remainder of my course through Indiana and into Kentucky, and made sure my logs would permit it. Most of Indiana was a piece of cake, but of course Indianapolis was not permitting a 60 mph pass through. Typical big city traffic slowed me down, and each double press of the oversized clutch pedal made my legs burn and ache.The sun went down, the road started getting hilly and by the time I finally exited Louisville I knew I&rsquo;d made a mistake.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It never occured to me that long distance driving would be a physical challenge in any way except for my bladder. Certainly, having to pee was an issue, but the act of driving a machine this large would wreck you if you let it. Your back would get sore, your legs would get tired, your arms need to move a much larger wheel than you&rsquo;d see on any regular vehicle. At some point you brain starts desperately looking for a way to make it stop. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I remembered reading a story about a huge black dragon that had been imprisoned underground for a hundred years. When it was finally set free, the beast soared into the night air and flew among the clouds in the moonlight until it could no longer flap its wings. The mighty magical creature came crashing to the ground in a fantastic wreck, too tired to make a proper landing. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My leg shook with each press of the heavy metal clutch as I came over another hill looking desperately for any sign of a truck stop. I was seriously considering peeing on the side of the road when I finally saw a giant glowing sign for diesel fuel. I sighed with great relief as I took the next exit and rolled away from the endless stretch of concrete I&rsquo;d been chasing for hours. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The low grade road I soon found myself on ended at a &ldquo;T&rdquo; intersection with only one option that wasn&rsquo;t posted with a &ldquo;No Trucks&rdquo; sign. I was forced onto a small road aiming straight up a steep hill to a small gas pump and convenience store. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There was no room for my truck.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Without any other option, I crawled up to the entrance to the station scanning with every ounce of my dwindling hope for some place to turn around. It was all I could do to avoid hitting the canopy over the gas pumps and park with my trailer half in the road. A manager came out to greet me as I climbed down from my rig. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t park that here,&rdquo; he was already waving me on.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;I just need to figure out how to turn around.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It wasn&rsquo;t easy, but with some patience from another customer trying to leave and some well intentioned useless hand signals from the manager I managed to get pointed back down the hill. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Petro just a few miles ahead,&rdquo; he yelled up at my window as I pulled away.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The image of the massive black dragon crashing into the dirt came back to mind as I reluctantly pulled back onto the freeway. Only now, the dragon in my mind was happy because it could pee. I was suddenly very sorry that I neglected to take care of that during my ordeal at the gas station.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The quiet but growing chatter on my cb radio was the first indicator I&rsquo;d get that I was close to the Petro Truck Stop. I was never so glad to hear strangers making fun of each other in my life. It took every bit of strength and concentration I had left to back that mile long trailer into the last sliver of a parking spot behind the lights of the truckers only entrance. If I didn&rsquo;t have to pee so bad, I probably would&rsquo;ve slept right there over that giant steering wheel. Instead I took off my seat belt, opened the door, and fell flat on my ass next to my truck. For a moment I thought I&rdquo;d have to pee right there, laying in the dirt. Instead I grabbed the running board on the side of the tractor and pulled myself to my feet. My legs felt like rubber, but I managed to somehow reach the restroom before it was too late. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Later that night as I made up numbers for my log book I swore to myself, I&rsquo;d never make that mistake again.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
