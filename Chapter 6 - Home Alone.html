Not that it feels like home anymore. Parking my truck at HQ and hopping into my &lsquo;89 Beretta felt bizarre. I kept reaching for the clutch and making wide right turns all the way to my house in the dark. The place looked abandoned as I pulled into the driveway; no lights on at all. I guess I never really thought my unsteady relationship with Emily would survive long with me on the road for 2 weeks at a time, but her sudden silent disappearance was hard to take. Her friends assured me she was ok, but she didn&rsquo;t want to see me again. I was surprised she didn&rsquo;t even leave me a note. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My roommate Tim was also curiously absent, but showed up the next day for a shower and clean set of clothes. &ldquo;Holy shit, you&rsquo;re back!&rdquo; He said fumbling with his key in the front door as he came in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, feels weird!&rdquo; I said getting up off the couch. &ldquo;I need to get out and do something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lemme clean up and we&rsquo;ll figure something out,&rdquo; he said on his way to the bathroom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I called the theater at the mall to see what was playing. The pre-recorded message listed all the shows and times for the day. We decided to see a sci-fi called &ldquo;The Matrix&rdquo;. The movie did pretty well in theaters, but for me it was a real game changer. If it was possible to film something like this, anything you could imagine could be made into a movie. That thought would help me through the boredom of the endless road that lie ahead. There were of course, events that took my full concentration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
