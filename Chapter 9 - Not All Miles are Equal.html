The products they shipped were of very high value, but the security was quite simple. There were no concrete walls, no watch towers or armed guards. Just miles and miles of nothing. The facility was hours from anything, and I mean anything. You could fire a cannon in any direction without concern - you wouldn&#39;t hit anything. The paperwork came with an unusual contract. I was to drive to the next handoff location without making a stop of any kind. Bring a snack and pee before you leave, because it was you and the open road for the next 4 hours. This was to prevent anyone from following you until your guard was down. This seemed a bit over the top to me since any suspicious car out here would stand out like the only 4 wheeler for miles on an endless stretch of concrete; because that&rsquo;s exactly what they&rsquo;d be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I took out my truckers atlas and tried to map out the most direct route to my destination. The main highway went a considerable length west before a junction allowed for any northerly progress, and north is where I needed to go. So I decided to take the state route just east of the facility to avoid going the long way around. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I should&rsquo;ve noticed right away that when everyone else turned left, perhaps they knew something I didn&rsquo;t. I convinced myself that they must not need to head north and made my mistake with both eyes wide open. It seemed reasonable to me at first, the road was a bit narrower than the freeway but headed directly north for a solid hour before it started getting a bit sketchy. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Not sketchy like I was concerned about being mugged, but like 25 mph curves sketchy. Nothing you&rsquo;d think twice about in a car, but those signs with the truck leaning to one side were meant for me. And it was just getting started.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">After another hour of deep breaths and carefully navigated arcs in the road as I climbed into the hills, &nbsp;I found myself at a horrible cross road. The right and left options were unpaved logging routes and the option straight ahead had a sign posted that read &ldquo;Trailers over 30 feet prohibited&rdquo;. My trailer was 53 feet long and this was not an intersection where I could just make a u-turn. I double checked my map to see what my options looked like. Going back, if I could even manage to turn around, would mean adding another 2 hours before I could stop. I&rsquo;d just driven almost that long and going another 6 to my drop off location without stopping was less than appealing to say the least. The windy part of the road looked short on the map, and I&rsquo;d probably be in the clear within the next 30 minutes if I just pressed on. So I doubled down, released the brakes, and rolled past the &ldquo;No trucks&rdquo; sign and into my first 15 mph curve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For almost 2 hours I cursed that decision while I swung wide across the double line again and again hoping that nobody was coming the other direction. The cliff wall on my right and the sharp drop off on my left made sure that I wouldn&rsquo;t entertain any ideas about stopping or turning around. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Somehow I reached straighter roads and found my way to the freeway on the other side. My shortcut cost me 3 extra hours and made sure I missed my handoff time. I&rsquo;d have to find a pay-phone and explain myself to my dispatcher. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hi, Tod, it&rsquo;s Patrick,&rdquo; I said wincing into the phone. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You missed your delivery window,&rdquo; he said without bothering to exchange any greetings. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, I took a wrong turn,&rdquo; I started to say. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What were you thinking taking that route?&rdquo; He knew where I&rsquo;d been. Our trucks were being tracked by GPS. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It looked like it would actually save time on the map,&rdquo; I explained. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Next time ask someone.&rdquo; He said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look for someone to make the pickup.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is there anything you need me to do in the meantime?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you a message when I find your next load.&rdquo; He said and hung up. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Another driver would come along soon and relieve me of my load, but I wouldn&#39;t get a new order for 24 hours. This was not accidental, this was how they got you to make your delivery times. When you get paid by the mile, sitting still cuts deep into your paycheck. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
