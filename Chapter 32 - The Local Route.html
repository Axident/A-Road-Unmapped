But if he didn&rsquo;t know that yet, what was this about?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It checked out I guess,&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t want to make a big deal over the phone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo; He continued, &ldquo;Gotta be safe - and drive save. Always be aware of everything around you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; This was getting weird.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d tell me if anything happened right?&rdquo; He let that question hang in the cold morning air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was scrambling to imagine where he might be going with this. My mind landed on the driver who tried to say I caused an accident. &ldquo;Hey if this is about the near miss in New York, that&#39;s all it was. I think he was going to try some insurance scam thing but I never hit that guy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well that&#39;s good,&rdquo; he sounded confused, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m wondering about the fence in New Jersey. &ldquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh man, I&rsquo;ll never forget that drop off, &ldquo; I explained, &ldquo;Scary as hell. I couldn&rsquo;t find anyone on site and the only spot left was against that rickety old fence. Honestly, I&rdquo;m pretty sure it was broken before I got there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well they have you on camera backing into it,&rdquo; he was obviously disappointed, &ldquo;so Schneider&rsquo;s buying them a new one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t believe it, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s messed up. I was just trying to make a delivery without getting mugged.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard bad things from other drivers about that location. I think we&rsquo;re done with them anyway. But you need to tell me when things like this happen, alright?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sure, I&rdquo;m sorry. I wasn&rsquo;t even sure I hit that fence,&rdquo; I started to explain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Listen, I&rsquo;ve got some good news.&rdquo; He suddenly changed tone, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a local route in St. Paul we need covered if you want it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you mean, local route?&rdquo; This wasn&rsquo;t a term I&rsquo;d heard before. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a daily run inside the metro area, you&rsquo;d be home every night.&rdquo; He had a catch though, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just temporary until Richard gets back from medical leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you kidding? That sounds great! How long?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A few months tops.&rdquo; He started typing something on his computer, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll take it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Totally! When does it start?&rdquo; I was looking forward to something a bit less crazy than the road I&rsquo;d been seeing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As soon as I can get you back to St. Paul,&rdquo; he paused, &ldquo;sound good?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; I thanked him and hung up the phone. This was going to be so cool, I&rsquo;d get to see Michelle every day! She&rsquo;s going to be so surprised!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
