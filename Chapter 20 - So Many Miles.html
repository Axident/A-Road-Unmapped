There are some significant mountains at the west end of Montana, and the challenge of driving a big rig on those inclines did a great job of occupying my thoughts. Obviously, when you pull 40 tons up to the top of a mountain you&rsquo;re not going very fast. The engine in one of those tractors isn&rsquo;t designed for torque at high speed. But given enough time, a semi truck will drag eventually drag the heaviest load to the summit without breaking a sweat. It&rsquo;s not terribly difficult for the driver either. You downshift into low &nbsp;gear and let the machine do it&rsquo;s thing.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Going down the other side is another matter altogether. All that weight behind you wants nothing more than to shove you out of the way and scream down to the bottom. All 5 axles are equipped with more than enough breaking power to stop you, but you can&rsquo;t just keep them partially applied the whole way down. Every few hundred feet of breaking adds heat to the system and with enough heat comes expansion. The metal begins to glow and press together beyond the integrity threshold of the system. At a certain point, the breaks will fail altogether becoming either completely useless or causing sudden lockup of one or more axles. If you don&rsquo;t jacknife, you&rsquo;ll begin to pick up an uncontrollable amount of speed. That&rsquo;s what those runaway ramps are for on the side of mountain highways. They&rsquo;re full of soft sand and gravel so that if a truck is out of control it can plow into the substrate and hopefully slow to a stop. Hopefully.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since a prolonged gentle application of the breaks isn&rsquo;t an option, truckers have to employ other methods to maintain control. The engine break, or &ldquo;jake break&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s sometimes called is a set of gears that drag down the momentum of the tractor without damaging the engine or breaks. It&rsquo;s a terribly loud system and doesn&rsquo;t completely negate the force of gravity when rolling down a mountain road. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The real trick is to keep the truck at a low speed overall by pressing hard on the breaks and letting go for a moment to let them cool. When you&rsquo;re off the break you&rsquo;ll speed up, but not an overwhelming amount if you&rsquo;re in a low gear. The older trucks, like the one I was driving could only be shifted into gears that matched your current RPM and speed. On normal flat roads, the spin of the engine and the speed you were moving at were close enough that you wouldn&rsquo;t have to consciously match the RPM. If it was a little off, you&rsquo;d hear a great grinding sound but the gear would probably catch and you&rsquo;d only really injure your pride. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On a significant downward slope however, you might have get that gear in place with a little nudge on the gas between clutching out of the previous gear and into the next one. If you didn&rsquo;t get it the first try, &nbsp;the gear might not catch at all. The breaks will feel less powerful in this scenario because you&rsquo;re effectively in a neutral free fall and now the breaks are all you have to slow you. The pressure you feel in this moment is real.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I learned quickly that once I started down an incline, put the truck in low gear and don&rsquo;t touch it. Just take your time and let gravity and carefully timed pumps of the breaks let you roll slowly to the bottom. Pick up speed in the valley and then drop back down a few gears as you lose momentum on your way up the next hill. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This pattern continued for hours without any sign of life until I noticed what seemed to be a slow moving river hugging the left side of the freeway. The road leveled off at some 2,000 feet up and the stress of the drive began to fade. What I first thought was a river, became wider and wider, until it finally revealed itself as Lake Coeur d&#39;Alene. That sight, that wonderful glistening blue lake dotted with sailboats and fishermen after days of lonely freeway, forest fires and steep mountain roads was like hearing angels singing. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hadn&rsquo;t noticed it on the map when I was planning my route, so I had no idea if there was a place to stop. I took it all in at 65 miles per hour and continued on to the west coast. My descent from the mountains into Washington was nearly as beautiful. Endless fields of sunflowers rolled over and over the foothills all the way into the state. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My delivery in Tacoma was a simple exchange of trailers. I traded my load for a new one destined for Ft, Worth and stopped for gas and a bite to eat just outside of town. I know most people will say that the weather in Seattle is always raining, but I&rsquo;ll never forget eating breakfast with a clear view of Mt. Rainier.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had just seen more than I could fully process, but this trip was just getting started. Over the next 4 days, I would drive another 2000 miles. In addition to sending me back through Idaho, this next leg introduced me to Oregon, Utah, New Mexico and Texas. By the time I returned to Wisconsin, I&rsquo;d been through 13 other states, all of my clean clothes and every type of truck stop hamburger known to man. The problem was, once I parked the truck back at headquarters I had nowhere to go. I had stopped living at the duplex I was renting with Tim and all my stuff was in storage. But there was still one place in Green Bay that I knew I could always get a hot meal and a place to rest.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
