You don&rsquo;t think about it much when the cb is chattering or when you&rsquo;re rolling along at 65 mph and wondering what makes a good sci-fi movie. But when you&rsquo;re all alone in a place where you would expect people, that&#39;s when my spidey senses start tingling. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I pulled up across from my drop off location and waited for the train to pass. Its horn rang through the industrial park in the middle of the night echoing off the concrete buildings. The bell stopped rigging and the red and white cross guard raised allowing me to drive into the gravel lot. There was a simple guard shack at the edge of the chain link fence that surrounded the place, but nobody was in it. My headlights were the only illumination as I drove up and down the few rows of parked trailers and found no sign of a single soul. An old 4 door sedan with tinted windows was idling across the railroad tracks with its lights off. It looked parked, but I could see a small cloud of exhaust stirring at the end of the tailpipe. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was way after hours, too late to call dispatch for advice. I had a pickup scheduled in a few hours and needed to get rid of this load, so I took the only parking spot left. None of this seemed safe, but at least this spot was against the fence, so if I parked close enough nobody could swing open my trailer doors. The trailers next to me were parked at odd angles, making it difficult to see that they were not 53 foot trailers like mine. So when I used their length to gauge how far I needed to back up, I soon heard the back of my trailer tap the chain link fence I was trying to get close to. I sighed and went back to check for damages. The fence was leaning a bit, but by the looks of it this fence was leaning before I got here. As I went to check if the other trucks positions could help verify if I&rsquo;d moved the fence, I heard a car door shut across the street. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Time to go.&rdquo; I said to myself and dropped the trailer legs. I pulled the handle to release the load and drove away as quick as I could.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
