The wonderful loft she was living in when we met started to seem small for the 2 of us, and we began to want something with more space for entertaining. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We found a beautiful 2 story craftsman with a finished attic for rent and the landlady liked us immediately. She would live in the ground floor, and Michelle and I would rent the upper floors for less than half of our combined monthly income. It had multiple rooms for entertaining, a full kitchen, on-site laundry, a yard for Casey, multiple parking spots and it was walking distance to a wonderful shopping district. It may not have had the view of Michelle&rsquo;s old place, but it was a definite step up. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After we moved to a neighborhood with parking spots, it would be possible to bring my Beretta over from Wisconsin. The plan would be for Michelle to drive to work in her car, and I could leave mine at the Schneider lot during the day. We never got a chance to see how that played out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The day after moving day, Michelle needed her car to clean up at the old loft so we could get our security deposit back. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen where you work,&rdquo; she laughed as we scraped ice off the windshield, &ldquo;For all I know, you go off and rob a convenience store every day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I like to use your car!&rdquo; I joked. &ldquo;You sure you&rsquo;re ok driving up to Schneider and back twice today?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Or what? You&rsquo;ll take a taxi?&rdquo; She took off her gloves and put her hands over the heater as we got in the car. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; and added, &ldquo;and thanks for cleaning up the loft. Don&rsquo;t work to hard on it, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll get the deposit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she nodded, &ldquo;I just want to leave it nice, I&rsquo;d be embarrassed if someone came in and found it dirty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sure, I get that,&rdquo; I turned on the radio and drove us to the truck lot.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I called it the Schneider lot, but it was just a multipurpose warehouse that Schneider was leasing part of. There were a couple of our big orange rigs and an odd trailer or 2. And then of course, there were the specialty trailers at the end of the building. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I unplugged my rig, warmed up the engine and began my morning routine. I&rsquo;d driven this machine thousands of miles through 43 states over the course of a year. I was now free to pursue a career driving for another outfit if I wanted, but this gig was pretty good. I had gotten used to this old tractor. I&rsquo;d made this machine my home, and I still kept all my road trip stuff in it. I had clothes, a mattress and blankets, a cooler, my radio and music collection, a small collection of tools and maps and dozens of log books. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hooked up a trailer for my first run of the day and pulled out of the yard. I waved to Steve as he pulled in, ready for work. The drive to the seat factory was already familiar. It was a few turns to the freeway and then over the Mississippi river into Wisconsin. Less than an hour later I&rsquo;d be in a small town in the middle of nowhere, pulling into a quiet industrial park.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our crew lead must&rsquo;ve been up pretty early, he was already pulling out of the dock when I arrived. He drove past me as I turned away from the building to get into position for backing. I climbed down from my truck and opened the trailer doors. It was a pretty easy dock to back into, the only trick was lining up the bumper with the spring loaded mechanism that triggered the loading system. At this point I could land exactly as I needed to in one shot. The light on the wall turned green, and I could feel the machines doing there thing in the trailer behind me. A few minutes later I was fully loaded.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Steve was pulling up as I pulled out of the dock. I waved as I shut the trailer doors and watched him get into position. He&rsquo;d obviously done this more than I had, and made the whole turn look effortless. I climbed back into my truck and rolled out to the end of the lot. There was never any traffic here besides us, so I made a soft stop and continued out to the main road. My trailer had a different idea.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">----------------------------------------------------------</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clunk - BOOM!!!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">----------------------------------------------------------</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The trailer had popped free of the fifth wheel and landed in the street. The pull handle had finally failed. I immediately pulled over and hopped out of my truck, but there was nothing I could do. The trailer landed on its legs and slid into the snowbank on the far side of the street. At first I couldn&rsquo;t even see if the legs were damaged. I put my gloves on and scooped enough snow out of the way to reach the leg crank.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a few minutes Steve pulled over next to the mess and joined me on the side of the road. &ldquo;Dude, what happened?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The pull handle,&rdquo; I tried to explain, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been sticking. It must not have locked in place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; He asked, running his fingers through his hair in disbelief.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try and crank the legs down, I guess,&rdquo; I was desperate for a solution, &ldquo;maybe I can get back underneath it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to use the small adjustment setting or you&rsquo;ll never be able to turn the crank.&rdquo; He knew this wasn&rsquo;t a good plan.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a better idea,&rdquo; I changed the setting on the leg crank.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dude, that&rsquo;s going to take hours!&rdquo; Steve seemed scared for me now, &ldquo;When the others see this, they&rsquo;re gonna call it in!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; I said turning the crank with little hope, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they will.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow, man&hellip;&rdquo; he started, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok,&rdquo; I said picking up the pace, &ldquo;nobody got hurt.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Steve got back in his rig. &ldquo;Good luck,&rdquo; he called out from his window before driving off.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was right about the others calling in. Within about 20 minutes of cranking someone walked over from the warehouse. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Leave it.&rdquo; A heavy-set bearded man said as he approached. His voice sounded like he was giving a command to a dog. &ldquo;Your dispatcher wants you to call him immediately.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The message light was blinking on the console of my truck when I climbed in to get my phone. I cleared the inbox without looking, took a deep breath and called headquarters.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So were you going to call me or what?&rdquo; My dispatcher sounded furious.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Absolutely, I just wanted to try and get it out of the road,&rdquo; I answered honestly.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother,&rdquo; He snapped, &ldquo;A tow truck is on it&rsquo;s way. Get your truck to the repair center for inspection. Directions are being sent now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I hung up the phone and wrote down the location from the console. The place was familiar, it was where they sent me when I had warped heads last month.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The same guy I&rsquo;d talked to last time was there to take my keys when I arrived. I didn&rsquo;t even need to explain why I was there, Schneider had already called it in. After about 30 minutes the mechanic came back into the office and walked right past me. Instead of telling me what he&rsquo;d discovered, he went to the phone. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There was a brief exchange, some nodding and then he looked up at me and said, &ldquo;They want to talk to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s company policy in these sort of situations to terminate your employment.&rdquo; my dispatcher said flatly.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wait, what?&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t believe this was happening, &ldquo;it was the pull handle - the equipment failed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The equipment was just verified by a mechanic.&rdquo; He explained without emotion, &ldquo;The scratches on the fifth wheel indicate you misaligned the kingpin. This ends your employment with Schneider, effective immediately.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; the reality was still sinking in, &ldquo;Can I at least drive home?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The truck is company property,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re no longer permitted to use it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But all my stuff is in there&hellip;&rdquo; I had no idea how to work this.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can obviously get your stuff out, but you&rsquo;ll need to arrange for your own transportation.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Is there really nothing you can do for me here?&rdquo; I pleaded. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. Thank you for your service.&rdquo; He said hanging up.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I set the phone down and tried to remain calm. The repair shop manager came over and took the phone back asking, &ldquo;Can I call you a cab?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;My stuff isn&rsquo;t going to fit in a cab.&rdquo; I took a deep breath, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try and get ahold of my girlfriend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sat in the lounge and looked through the window at my rig parked in the last maintenance bay. There was no answer on Michelle&rsquo;s phone.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sweetie, something happened at work - I&rsquo;m ok but I need you to call me right away.&rdquo; I left a message on her machine. Then I realized that the machine was sitting by itself in our new kitchen. Michelle was over at the loft cleaning up. I&rsquo;d need to find a different solution.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I watched as another truck entered the next repair bay. The mechanic hopped out of the rig and went over to the huge garage door. He pressed a large black button on the wall and waited for the massive aluminum door to roll down. Then he went out through a side door. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I walked up to where the manager was making a note at his desk and asked him, &ldquo;Can I get my keys to get my stuff from my truck?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He nodded and took my old familiar keyring off a hook on the wall and handed it to me.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I walked out into the maintenance bays and climbed up into &ldquo;my rig&rdquo;. Sure it was company property now, but it was the rig I&rsquo;d called home for months. I&rsquo;d pulled loads over mountains, to railyards and garbage dumps, through floods, past forest fires and across the endless plains in-between. Nearly everything I owned was in this truck and now without any warning at all, I&rsquo;m supposed to pay money to pack what I can into a taxi cab for a ride home? This isn&rsquo;t even my fault - that mechanic who blew off my concern for the pull handle had every reason to put the blame on me. How could they not even let me drive home after trusting me for all those miles? I was less than an hour away from my new house and now I couldn&rsquo;t even drive home, let alone explain to Michelle how I plan to pay for rent. What would the harm be in driving home? What would they do, fire me some more?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The truck that was just brought in blocked a direct line of sight to most of the rest of the room. I looked around to see where the mechanic went but I couldn&rsquo;t find him. I climbed down from my truck and examined the closed garage door in front of me - the only thing preventing me from leaving. As though it was just another day at work in the repair center, I walked over to the black button next to my door and pressed it. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The door raised an inch from the floor.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I realized, I would have to press the button the whole time. Without another moment of hesitation, I pressed the button and held it. The door raised another foot, then another. After a few of the longest seconds of my life, the door finally reached the top of the garage. I cooly walked back to my truck and hopped in. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My heart was beating so loud I didn&#39;t even hear the engine start when I turned the key. I wasn&rsquo;t about to look around to see if anyone was going to stop me, I just released the breaks and rolled forward. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The light across the street was green so I kept going. I was about 15 minutes down the road before the message light started blinking on my console. I didn&rsquo;t have to look, I could guess what it would say. When traffic got thick enough on the freeway that I found myself stopped, I decided to take a peek. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">*** </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Return the tractor to the repair center at once! You are driving STOLEN PROPERTY!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">***</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The down arrow was lit indicating that more text was below this, but I had read enough. I had done a stupid thing, and now I was in deep trouble. I tried to imagine the best and worst case scenarios from here. I suppose it would&rsquo;ve been a lot of yelling, maybe a fine; I really had no idea what was waiting for me if I turned around. Probably the same if I kept going, but at least then I&rsquo;d get a chance to dump my stuff off at the house and maybe see Michelle. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Red and blue flashing lights in my side view mirror made my heart sink. &ldquo;Here we go,&rdquo; I thought to myself and looked for a place to pull over. The cop car drove right past me down the shoulder and up to an accident further down the road. I was not going to get pulled over on this run, but it would be my last.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">An hour later, I pulled the truck into a church parking lot at the end of the street in our new neighborhood. I gathered an arm load of blankets and a piece of luggage with a weeks worth of clothes and walked up to our new place. Michelle&rsquo;s car was parked out front, so I knew I&rsquo;d have some explaining to do. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">She actually took it rather well, despite knowing that I was now out of work and we just signed a year lease on a much more expensive rental. We took her car over and gathered what remained of my things and left the truck where it was. I phoned my dispatcher after hours to leave a message explaining where it could be found. Schneider decided not to press charges, and the truck was hauled away by a tow truck the next day. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I still had to figure out what I was going to do next. I still had a strong desire to see how computer graphics for movies were made. There was a computer art school in Minneapolis, maybe I should see where that road goes?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
