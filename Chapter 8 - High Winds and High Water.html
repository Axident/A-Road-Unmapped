Is anyone here?&rdquo; I called through the front door held open by a large rock. The sign that would&rsquo;ve &nbsp;told me I was in the right spot had been recently removed. The only reason I kept trying was the discolored paint from where the sign had been still spelled the name of the small business who requested a pickup. They didn&rsquo;t have a loaded trailer for me to haul, and Schneider knew it, so I was here with an empty ready for whatever they needed hauled. That wasn&rsquo;t unusual. The weird part was the lack of any loading dock or even a place to park. I was currently occupying half the parking spots I guessed were normally used by the employees and customers of this building.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh good, you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; a round balding man came up to the front pushing a massive crt computer monitor on a wheeled office chair. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your truck?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I stepped aside so he could see the huge orange trailer right behind me. &ldquo;Do you guys have a loading dock?&rdquo; I asked foolishly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ha, no.&rdquo; The man abandoned his chair and yelled out to the back, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s here start hauling that stuff out to the parking lot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Over the next hour and a half, I watched in horror and fascination as 2 guys wheeled, dragged and stacked the entire contents of the office space into the back of the trailer. They piled monitors on desks, stacked wheeled chairs and filing cabinets and boxes from floor to ceiling without any secure straps or plastic wrap. It looked like Office Depot threw up. At the end of the ridiculous loading procedure, one of them hands me a clipboard with an insane list of items vaguely representing the mess I was looking at. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is this the manifest?&rdquo; I asked. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; he said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You know this probably isn&rsquo;t going to arrive still stacked like this,&rdquo; I said signing my part of the paperwork. &ldquo;A lot of stuff will likely fall, maybe even brake&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The fuck do I care.&rdquo; He took the page without looking and went back inside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;ll never know what kind of situation I was witnessing. Did these people just lose their jobs? Was this guy just having a bad day? You never know what you&rsquo;re going to run into at a pickup site. All you had to do was haul stuff and fill out forms. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t my duty to secure everything inside. The paperwork absolved me from that responsibility. So I shut the doors, placed the seal and entered the time in my log book. I was headed to Baton Rouge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Taking highway 10 out of New Orleans offers a unique interstate experience. Large parts of the highway are suspended a few feet over lakes and swamp water. Moss covered trees stand shoulder to shoulder all along the roadside. I would&rsquo;ve liked to have seen more of it in the sun, but dark clouds brought an early end to daylight. Not long after the first few drops of rain, lightning began tracing across the sky and a howling wind through its terrible force at the broad side of my trailer. A storm unlike any I&rsquo;d ever driven through was soon upon me and there was nowhere to hide. I was terrified thinking that the wind might actually tip me over so out of desperation I took the next exit that seemed like a major road.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;It definitely felt better off the main interstate but there still wasn&rsquo;t a good place to stop. I was hoping for a good place to pull over, but right here the water was pretty high next to the road. The only thing I could imagine worse than getting knocked over on the interstate would be to sink and tip over into the mud in the middle of nowhere. So I drove on into the night.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A brilliant crack of lightning illuminated the outlines of buildings ahead, but there were no lights. Apparently the power was out. There was not a soul on the road as I pulled up to the first intersection in town. Even the stoplights had failed, or what passed for a stoplight. In this little town, the main intersection had a single light suspended by cables and hung in the center of the street about 15 feet of the ground. Or at least, that was probably about how high it was supposed to be. At this time, one of the supporting poles was leaning and the light hung lower than it should. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I waited for a while wondering what my next move should be. I definitely wasn&rsquo;t going to see another truck roll by and show me how close I would be. The light bounced and swayed in the wind, occasionally highlighted in the pouring rain by flashes of lightning. I steeled myself for the weather and cranked down my window. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Do you ever wonder what it would be like to go through a carwash with your window down? I don&rsquo;t. The rain blew sideways through my cab like a firehose. I took a deep breath and plunged my face outside. Slowly raising my foot off the clutch I rolled forward under the light dangling in front of me. The sound of the rain hitting the street seemed weird, like a shower in a clogged bathtub. Looking down I could see the water was up to my hubcap. On this truck that meant I was driving through at least a foot of water. Whatever I did, I couldn&rsquo;t stay there. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The swinging stoplight cleared just an inch or so above the top of my trailer. It bobbed and tapped my roof sounding like a bucked kicked down the length of it as I drove past.There must&rsquo;ve been some sort of curb or roundabout under the water that caused the real problem. Something caused my trailer to hop up on one side and tip strangely toward the right. It wasn&rsquo;t far enough that I feared tipping over, but it definitely shook up the contents when it came bouncing back down. Confident that I was through the worst of it, I cranked my window back up and pressed on. Within an hour I had made it to higher ground and finally found a place to catch my breath and change out of my wet clothes. This would not be the worst weather I&rsquo;d face. Thankfully, the drop off was park and forget. I never met the person who would be receiving that load. I&#39;d like to know what their face looked like when they opened those doors.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My worst road choice was yet to come. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
