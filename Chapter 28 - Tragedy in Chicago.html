It still meant I&rsquo;d be sent all over America for the rest of the time, but at least I knew I&rsquo;d be seeing a lot more of Michelle than I was before. Her voice made even the hardest days manageable. Some days were very hard. I&rsquo;d made my mistakes trying to drive too many miles so that wasn&rsquo;t going to be a problem again. The hours were mostly my own, and the loneliness was no longer an issue. But some trips take more out of you than expected. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My next run was a hand-off in Harrisburg. It&rsquo;s about a 1,000 mile trip through Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio before reaching Pennsylvania. That&rsquo;s less than 2 days on the road, I wouldn&rsquo;t even need to stop for gas. I would however, still need to drive through Chicago. This would be the last time I ever drove through that city. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It never occurred to me before this drive that suicide by semi was a thing I&rsquo;d need to watch out for. Even though I was not the poor trucker who&rsquo;s life was forever changed that day, my view of the aftermath is not something I&rsquo;ve ever been able to erase from my mind. I suppose when a person feels they need to leave this world, they&rsquo;ll take the easiest most certain path they can. 80,000 pounds moving at 60 mph is a fairly certain choice for someone standing roadside. The UPS driver in front of me was pulling double trailers when someone decided to involve them in their final moments. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I write this, I need to look away from the page and take a moment. Even now, nearly 20 years later, my mind needs time to process. It took some time before emergency vehicles were able to reach us. I sat there in my cab, stopped behind the scene processing the same thoughts then that I do now. I had come to a stop along side a parked car on the side of the raised section of freeway that enters the city. It occurred to me that this was probably the person&rsquo;s car. It seemed likely that they drove to this point and waited. Perhaps considered if the fall from here would be lethal. Then saw us approaching from around the bend and made their choice. It could&rsquo;ve just as easily been me in front. Instead, I was stopped with the rest of traffic who were now trapped in between stopped cars and the horror of this situation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were a couple of other truckers stuck alongside us who would also need the police to wave us around. The CB radio was full of voices guessing at what happened and trying to get answers. None of us who saw it said anything. I didn&rsquo;t even mention it to Michelle for a long time. But I did eventually talk to her later that evening. Without her comforting tone and sparkling spirit, I doubt I&rsquo;d have slept that night. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
