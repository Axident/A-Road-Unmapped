Oh this particular occasion I was directed to a small factory in Ohio where they manufactured huge custom fiberglass tubes for amusement park water slides. The pieces were packed in huge wood crates and padded with shredded wood shavings. To get them in the trailer, I needed to back my truck into the factory itself. They didn&rsquo;t have a loading dock for the really big orders like this one. The limited space required a custom trailer and a short nosed cabover truck like mine to make the turn. They supplied the trailer but I had to get it inside. After some careful maneuvering and some minor applause from the workers who were on the floor at the time, I was ready to get back on the road. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Since they provided the trailer, I was now being followed by a massive graphic for the fiberglass company. They apparently also made jet ski parts, as the side of my trailer was painted with a pair of life-sized jet skis hopping over gentle waves with smiling young couples on them. For the first time, my name wasn&rsquo;t Schneider.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It began to rain as I approached Toledo. It was a light sprinkle at first but I didn&rsquo;t want to drive in the pouring rain if I didn&rsquo;t have to and besides, it was lunch time. The diner was nothing special, but we were treated to one of the finest summer storm light shows the midwest has to offer. Everyone gathered at the large west facing windows to watch the massive dark clouds roll in. Flashes of light, roaring thunder and fantastic torrents of water all competed for our attention. After about 30 minutes, it suddenly lost the will to continue and the clouds gave way to sunshine as quickly as it started.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was surprised at the amount of standing water in the parking lot as I splashed my way to my truck. At least I had a fresh pair of socks and alternate set of boots in the cab. I made reasonable entries in my log and started towards the river. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The river was not happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sudden addition of all the runoff was far more than the Maumee was prepared to take and the on ramp to the freeway was not passable for your average vehicle. Several cars had tempted fate and now had their owners standing on the hoods as water flooded in through vents and cracks in the doors. The flood water was about 3-4 feet deep here, way more than any 4 wheeler could handle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was not in a 4 wheeler. I flicked on the cb to hear what other drivers were saying. Apparently somebody was convincing the officer blocking the freeway entrance that our trucks were capable of pushing through. In a few minutes we were given the &ldquo;all clear&rdquo; and the caravan began to lurch forward. Since our exhaust was directed upwards, we were in no danger of choking out our engines. We definitely had the torque to move through the water. The river was not ready to just give up though. It got deeper before we reached the beginning of the incline, but since we were all moving in unison the waves acted more like a waterslide than a force of resistance. That&rsquo;s when I remembered the graphic on my trailer. I laughed out loud in my truck as I pulled my happy jet skiers through the river water and up onto the bridge. I wish I had a picture of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On the other side of the river things were less controlled. The water wasn&rsquo;t as deep, but it covered the road for a significant distance. Our caravan of big rigs sloshed the water to the side again and again. At one point I noticed we were actually moving abandoned cars off to the side of the road. Eventually we cleared the water and most of us pulled into the first available truck stop to examine our trucks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I pulled a handful of weeds and mud off of the grill and verified the rest of my equipment checked out. Satisfied with the state of my rig I went inside to get some candy and a soda for the road. The lounge was filled with truckers making a similar snack run. I the weather report was on so I sat down in an empty seat in front of the widescreen tv in the theater room. As soon as I sat down, someone behind me asked, &ldquo;Hey driver, can you turn that up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; I said and leaned forward. The tv was more than out of reach, but not if I took one large step forward, balanced myself with my hand on the floor completing the tripod and reached far out with my other hand to hit the volume. My left foot never left the space in front of my seat, so I just rocked backward shifting my weight and pushing off the floor with my hand and landed fairly effortlessly back in my seat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll be damned!&rdquo; Someone in the back row was clearly impressed. &ldquo;We got a regular spiderman here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What, who?&rdquo; Someone else asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do that again, kid&rdquo; he asked me to change the volume again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I repeated the maneuver, one leg far forward, one leg back, my hand on the floor and my other arm stretched to full extension to reach the knob on the tv.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How about that,&rdquo; someone new said walking into the room. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s yer name, driver&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was it, the day I would stop being called Schneider. &ldquo;Spiderman,&rdquo; I smiled. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Got that right,&rdquo; they agreed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so it was. From then on when I grabbed the cb if an introduction was necessary - I was spiderman. It helped that when I got in my truck to leave, the name Schneider wasn&rsquo;t emblazoned across the doors. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
