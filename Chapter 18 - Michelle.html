We chatted about what crazy changes were going on in our lives all the way back to his place. When I got there, his wife Laura was on the phone with a friend and seemed fairly concerned for her. Apparently Laura wanted to go cheer her up but Michelle, the girl on the phone, told her it was ok and they could talk later when they didn&rsquo;t have company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh now I feel bad,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you should go comfort your friend.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I want to,&rdquo; Laura looked so torn, &ldquo;but I want to get to know Kevin&rsquo;s childhood friend too!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Call her back,&rdquo; I insisted, &ldquo;you should at least finish your conversation, I can wait.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Laura called her back and the conversation turned to explaining to Michelle who her company was. I can&rsquo;t remember who had the idea first, but we were soon discussing driving the 3 of us to Michelle&rsquo;s apartment. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll like her,&rdquo; Laura was quite pleased with this plan, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s very sweet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hope she doesn&rsquo;t mind me tagging along,&rdquo; I felt a small bit like an extra wheel.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; this will be fun.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you sure, you could just drop me off at my truck&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, she&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo; Laura felt like I needed more convincing, &ldquo;and she has huge boobs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well if she really needs people to come over and cheer her up, I don&rsquo;t want to get in the way of that,&rdquo; we all laughed.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The moment Michelle opened the door, I knew I&rsquo;d like her. Aside from matching Laura&rsquo;s description, her smile and laughter were infectious. She was embarrassed about her contacts prescription taking too long and she had to wear an old pair of glasses. I didn&rsquo;t mind one bit, this girl was hot in glasses. The night went well and we actually exchanged phone numbers. I didn&rsquo;t even know at the time, that this was the girl I&rsquo;d seen at Kevin&rsquo;s wedding.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
