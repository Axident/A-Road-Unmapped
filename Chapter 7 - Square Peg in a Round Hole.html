It was late in the afternoon and for some reason I needed to go inside the main building. This was not a typical loading dock or warehouse with forklifts and wooden pallets. I was at a foundry where they poured molten steel into forms on tracks from massive machines suspended overhead. It reminded me of the scene in The Terminator where the liquid nitrogen truck crashed and briefly froze the enemy robot. The robots here seemed far less likely to hunt anyone down, but were probably still quite dangerous. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once my load was ready, I hopped back into my truck and checked the display on the dashboard. Instructions were waiting for me to accept my next delivery, complete with turn by turn directions to the location. This was how Schneider would send me most of my information. Since computerized maps were not really a thing yet, those directions had to be followed exactly. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I made a habit of writing down the turns on a large notebook clipped to the dash. The computerized information was small and only showed a couple of lines at a time. I could easily follow the hand written ones without compromising my safety while I drove. The instructions got specific as they approached the pickup site, but didn&rsquo;t go into detail about how to leave Detroit. I pulled out my trucker&rsquo;s atlas and mapped out a simple route to the main highway and entered the time in my log book.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">How hard could it be to drive away from a city? Well it turns out that if you weigh 40 tons, you&rsquo;re not welcome on most roads. Have you ever noticed those signs that have the profile of what looks like a black moving truck inside a red crossed-out circle? Those signs are specifically for heavy trucks like this one. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The road I wanted to take out of this area had one of those signs on it. I soon found myself trying to gauge which direction I needed to go as I navigated through downtown city traffic during rush hour. The instructions I&rsquo;d written on the notebook were useless now and nobody was going to tolerate a big tuck stopping in the middle of traffic to look at a map. I decided to just drive straight until I either saw an on-ramp or eventually left the city. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A sign soon pointed the way, but it meant a fairly tight turn. The lane next to me was open so I swung wide around the corner and made my way to the freeway. It was a tiny bit closer than I had guessed and my trailer tires hopped up on the curb for a few feet as I finished the turn. I was watching closely to make sure nobody was anywhere near trailer while this happened, but I&rsquo;d need to be more careful. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The road came to a stop light where all I&rsquo;d need to do was drive straight to get on the highway. The light turned green and I pulled through the intersection toward what I assumed was my on-ramp. Instead the road curved slightly around a large building as it dove below the next block into a tunnel. Fighting panic I scanned for any sign to tell me how tall it was and found nothing. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was too late to change my mind or even stop before entering the round entrance, but clearly the middle was taller than the sides. I braked and switched into the middle lane hoping to minimize any damage if this didn&rsquo;t work. I tried to imagine the train bridge in Chicago and gauge if this would even be possible. In my imagination the arc of the tunnel passed just over the top of my trailer leaving a small amount of room for error.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luckily, I was right. The truck fit and I was dumped into the tranquil sea of stopped cars on the freeway. I had never been so glad to be stuck in evening traffic. Slowly the rush hour drive gave way to open road and I could settle into a long sunset ride into the country. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
