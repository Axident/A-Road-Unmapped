The road through the mountains and up the coast towards Maine is truly a sight to behold. The scenery is fantastic, the air smells different, and the harbor towns along the coast fascinated me. I&rsquo;d never seen the ocean first hand before and the sight of it was literally breathtaking. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was nearly lunch time, so I started looking for a place to pull over and give Michelle a call. She would love to hear about this part of the trip. Once I stopped, I pulled out my phone and saw the date on the screen. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it, I almost forgot to call my brother!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey bro,&rdquo; I said as he picked up, &ldquo;Happy Birthday!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh hey! Thanks!&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;Are you out on the road?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, guess where?&rdquo; I laughed, &ldquo;never mind, you&rsquo;ll never guess. I&rdquo;m in New Hampshire!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Really? What&rsquo;s it like?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So friggin beautiful, you wouldn&#39;t believe it.&rdquo; I went into a brief description of the landscape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Cool! Where are you headed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My next load is in Maine&rdquo; I explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to tell me how the lobster is,&rdquo; we laughed and let each other go, promising to talk more often.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Growing up in Wisconsin, lobster was about the only thing we knew that Maine had going for it. I was discovering that the state had plenty to offer, but there&#39;s a good reason people think lobster when they think about Maine. You can get it anywhere. Less than 30 minutes after hanging up with my brother I passed a sign for a fast food drive through that said &ldquo;Fresh lobster. Truckers welcome.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This had to be a joke, but I needed to be sure. I pulled my truck around back where there was room for my trailer and went inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you guys actually have lobster?&rdquo; I asked the teenager behind the register.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can get you one if you want, will you be travelling far with it?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This was not the response I was expecting. &ldquo;Can I eat it here?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a live lobster, sir.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; I laughed, &ldquo;I guess not then! You guys don&rsquo;t cook them here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not anymore. But we still run and get them from the store across the street if you want one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; I was still laughing, &ldquo;no thanks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can I get you something else?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good, thanks anyway,&rdquo; I said smiling and turned to the door. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I did hear some other truckers on the CB radio later mentioning that you could get lobster at the drive-throughs in Maine, but I never got clarification on whether you could get one cooked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
