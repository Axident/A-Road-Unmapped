The time it took to drive through the city would tell me how far I could really expect to go that day. As luck would have it, my drive time beat expectations and allowed my to plot a course deep into Ohio. I&rsquo;d be going just over 600 miles today, but the biggest city on my route was already behind me. A minor rounding error in my log book here and there would pad my numbers and I could cover the distance to St. Paul without any trouble. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The only time anyone ever looked at the log was if you were randomly selected for inspection at a weigh station. Half the time those things were closed, the other half they were a minor interruption in an otherwise eventless day on the road. If the sight says &ldquo;Scales Open - All Trucks Must Stop&rdquo;, you don&rsquo;t have a choice. The scales they were were referring to are actual scales - not so different from the one on the floor of your bathroom. You wait your turn to approach the carwash style stoplight and pull onto the large grey pad when the light turns green. You stop for a second when it turns red and they check the weight of your truck one axle at a time. The front axle pretty much always weighs the same, about 12 thousand pounds. The 8 drive tires under the fifth wheel aren&rsquo;t allowed to weigh more than 34 thousand pounds. The remaining 8 tires at the end of your trailer have the same limit. If too much weight is over the drive tires, you actually have to slide the trailer tires up towards the fifth wheel to balance the load. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As I approached the scales the thought occurred to me that I wasn&rsquo;t certain this load was balanced correctly. In fact, I was only guessing that the contents actually matched the paperwork. I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw the numbers settle on the scoreboard. I was within legal tolerances. I looked over for the signal to go ahead, but the lady in the window was conferring with a co-worker. They both looked up at me simultaneously and waved me in. I was to pull over into the side lot for a complete vehicle inspection.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A man in a khaki uniform was waiting for me when I climbed down from the truck. He took my log book under one arm and said nothing as he proceeded to verify all the lights and air lines were in working order. He went over every axle from under the trailer with his blinding white Mag-light, marking down every detail on his clipboard. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Everything ok?&rdquo; I asked as he seemed to finish up.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Mmm, hm.&rdquo; he nodded and motioned to the scale house where we would go next. He pointed at a table where I should wait while he went into a separate room with my logs. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My mind turned every page in memory, trying to guess what they might be looking at in there. Would they notice the fuzzy accuracy I was using to maximize my mileage? Would they bust me for driving too far? What kind of fine would I get for that? What would Schneider do to me?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">6 years later the man came back out with my log book in hand.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where are you planning on resting tonight?&rdquo; he asked setting my paperwork down on the table between us without sitting down.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Soon, I&rsquo;m pretty much done today&rdquo; I had no idea how many miles I could still legally drive if any.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes you are.&rdquo; He said and slid my log toward me, &ldquo;drive safe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I tried to keep from dancing on the way back to my rig. I noted the time and carefully wrote down the duration of my stop. I kept my logs crystal clear after that night.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
