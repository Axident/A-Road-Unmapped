Not every job was going to be a simple pickup and drive. Sometimes you would need to bring an empty trailer to the site in order to get your load. This happens frequently enough, that empty trailers become a scarce commodity, cutting into your drive time and ultimately your paycheck. Experienced drivers will sometimes stash an empty behind other trailers or a warehouse for later. I had no such hiding spots, so when I needed an empty I went where my dispatcher thought there might be one. Sometimes he was right, sometimes the trailer was full of unexpected items.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The trailer he sent me to this time was full of canned peaches. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s where those ended up. Nice, can you do me a favor?&rdquo; He asked me when I told him what I was looking at.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sure, what do you need me to do?&rdquo; I wondered, how bad could it be?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Before you can use this trailer for your next load, I need you to donate those peaches.&rdquo; He said typing something into his computer. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a food shelter not far from where you are that will take &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The location was soon blinking on the console in my tractor. He was right, the spot wasn&rsquo;t too far from here. I could probably get this emptied and still make my pickup today. I shut the doors, backed under the nose and hooked up the air and electric lines. &ldquo;I hope they have a decent loading dock,&rdquo; I thought to myself as I cranked up the legs. It was getting hot already and the work was making me sweat. By the smell of things, I was definitely going to need a shower when I was done with this.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The food shelter was basically a storage shed behind a church. There was definitely not a loading dock. I couldn&rsquo;t even see a decent approach to get the trailer lined up. After about 15 minutes of maneuvering back and forth between the curbed islands and the cars in the parking lot I was still not ready to back up to the building. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A white haired man in a black shirt and a white collar soon came walking across the baking hot asphalt to see if I needed some help.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I think I can eventually get lined up,&rdquo; I eyeballed my next move, &ldquo;this will be tricky though.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I can see that. Do you want me to find the owners of some of these cars?&rdquo; he suggested.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; I said over confidently, &ldquo;I got this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What exactly are you delivering?&rdquo; He asked.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Canned fruit,&rdquo; I pointed my thumb at the trailer, &ldquo;I hope you like peaches.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Can I see?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t seem amused.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, did my dispatcher not call you?&rdquo; I said climbing down from the truck.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;though sometimes dispatchers are not fully aware of the quality of the delivery.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh man, OK.&rdquo; I said surprised and opened the doors.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The smell had gotten much worse. The cans were mostly stacked on pallets but many had fallen over and some were near the door. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The priest grabbed a can and looked up at me, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re wet.&rdquo; He took a look at the can and then back at me, now much more disgusted. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re expired.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I had no idea&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;I started.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You can tell your dispatcher we&rsquo;re done taking deliveries.&rdquo; He said putting the can back on the trailer and turning away.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; I called out after him, but it was too late. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">He waved without looking back at me and kept walking back to his church. I closed the trailer doors and contacted my dispatcher. He gave me another location - an actual garbage dump.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Driving to the dump wasn&rsquo;t that hard but on arrival they didn&rsquo;t seem any fonder of a Schneider truck rolling up than that priest did.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this then?&rdquo; A chubby woman with curly hair and glasses stopped me at the gate.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s canned fruit,&rdquo; I started, &ldquo;Did my dispatcher call you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t take that shit here,&rdquo; she folded her arms.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s spoiled, nobody will take it.&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;if not here, where?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">She put her hands on her hips. &ldquo;You wanna unload it yerself?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I can do that,&rdquo; I said, not fully aware of what I was signing up for.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We charge by the pound. You can go to the blue gate marked &ldquo;C&rdquo; after you get a receipt at the scale,&rdquo; she pointed to the scales on the side of the driveway headed into the dump.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I cleared the cost with my dispatcher and pulled up to the scales. After a few seconds of settling, the filthy rusted machine spit out a coil of paper with a barcode on it. I assumed this was my receipt and pulled up to the intersection at the end of the driveway. The arrows pointing to the left were orange and green with marks &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; on them. The blue arrow marked &ldquo;C&rdquo; pointed to the right, so that&#39;s where I went.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As I approached I could see a man dragging an overloaded cart with a broken wheel out of the fenced in pit. I tried to ask him how this worked, but he just pointed to the pile of refuse inside the gate. I turned around the trailer and swung open the doors. Somehow the smell had gotten even worse. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I got back into my truck and put on my steel toe boots, an old pair of jeans and a set of heavy work gloves. I turned up my boom box and climbed into the back of the trailer. The cans weighed 6 pounds each, stacked hip high for about &#8532; the length of the trailer. This would take longer than I thought.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At first I was throwing them underhanded one at a time off the end of the trailer, but as I got deeper in I had to throw further and further. I was sweating and breathing hard and took a moment to lean against one of the poorly stacked pallets. The bottom cans had ruptured and the whole pile suddenly fell over sending dozens of cans rolling down the trailer. A light bulb went lit up over my head.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After I cleared the runway of haphazardly aligned cans and empty pallets, I created a clear runway for the remaining load of peaches and &nbsp;fruit-cocktail. The cans that were still in tact rolled easy enough that I actually got pretty good at bowling with them. Many were to far gone and required a good boot to clear the end of the trailer. Once in a while, a can would be so far gone that kicking created more of a mess than anything, sending foul syrup all over the walls, my pants and shirt. By the time I finished, I was covered in the stuff but I had an empty trailer. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I closed the doors and drove back up to the entry gate. The woman at the gate had me get another reading from their old scale to compare the difference. I took the receipts back to the security shack where she managed the exit and waited for the bill. I don&rsquo;t know what I was hoping would happen next, perhaps an invoice or something I could take to Shneider for them to pay. Instead, I had to pay with a personal check. I missed my pickup, insulted a priest, got half a garbage dump in my clothes and hair, and it was going to cost me money - nice.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Schneider did end up paying me back of course, but I had to throw those clothes and gloves away. To this day, whenever anyone uses the phrase &ldquo;hot garbage&rdquo; I smell expired peaches.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
