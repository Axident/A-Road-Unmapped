It&rsquo;s 2 steps up and a bit of a sideways hop to put yourself into the driver&#39;s seat of an International 9800 Cabover, the truck I&rsquo;d learn to drive over the next 4 weeks. It was warm inside, the engine had been running for hours, maybe days. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Coffee?&rdquo; He asked, pouring fresh coffee from his thermos into a styrofoam cup on the console. He didn&rsquo;t wait for me to answer, &ldquo;grab a cup from the cabinet behind you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I turned to look behind my seat to see a full kitchenette with a microwave, mini fridge, and a bench seat facing a tv. &ldquo;You get cable on that thing?&rdquo; I joked as I marveled at his setup.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; I asked grabbing a cup of coffee. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You can plug into ports at most of the big chain truck stops.&rdquo; He said, pointing at a small stack of brochures on the dashboard. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is crazy,&rdquo; I shook my head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get used to it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I wanted to sound ready. &ldquo;Where we going?&rdquo; I asked and put my hands on the wheel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Easy big guy, enjoy your coffee.&rdquo; He looked out at the gas pump, &ldquo;we still have a few minutes before the tanks are filled. And we&rsquo;re still waiting for my other student.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A young woman came out of the training center soon and topped of the tanks. She put the handles back on the pumps on both sides of the truck and Nick stood up to let her hin. She climbed passed us without saying a word and layed down to sleep on the bench in the kitchen. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alice is not a morning person either,&rdquo; Nick laughed and sat back down in the passenger seat. He leaned forward and pointed to the row of trailers on the far side of the parking lot. &ldquo;N0417682&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I pushed in the clutch and put my hand on the shifter and realized I had no idea what he just said. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s our trailer,&rdquo; he pointed, &ldquo;third one in line over there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; I put on my determined face and shifted into gear. I wheeled the truck into position and started to back slowly toward my load. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hold up,&rdquo; Nick stopped me, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s close enough.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I pushed in the clutch and pulled out of gear. Nick waited for me to press the oversized red button on the dash to engage the air brake and hopped to the ground. I followed him around the back of the truck to inspect the trailer. It was in good condition; the tires had plenty of tread, the air lines seemed in good shape and the seal on the back doors was in tact. I finished backing up to my load and felt the solid thunk of the metal king pin landing snug into the 5th wheel. I hopped back out of the truck to finish hooking up the trailer air and electric lines.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As I began turning the crank to raise the legs, I started to ask Nick, &ldquo;So Alice&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll take her turn tomorrow morning,&rdquo; Nick knew what I was wondering, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll do the drive home. For now it&rsquo;s on you and she&rsquo;ll take over for the return trip.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; I started to get back in the truck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;One last thing before you pull away,&rdquo; Nick pointed at the 5th wheel, &ldquo;double check the pull handle to make sure it&rsquo;s locked in place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; I examined the handle to make sure it had snapped into position when we backed under the trailer. &ldquo;Do these fail sometimes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Not really. Not unless something&#39;s wrong,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;But if it does fail and you drop your load - you&rsquo;re fired. No questions asked.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I nodded and climbed back into the truck. &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Head for the southbound freeway, this truck only drives one route.&rdquo; Nick marked down our time in a standard truckers log book. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to Chicago.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">If you google &ldquo;worst cities in america to drive&rdquo;, or &ldquo;worst traffic cities in america&rdquo; &nbsp;Chicago is in the top 10 of every result. It&rsquo;s the 3rd most populous city in America and last year had 58 million domestic and international visitors. What I&rsquo;m trying to say is, there are a lot of people in Chicago and many are from out of town. The freeways are horribly congested. Most people with a destination on the other side of Chicago go around the city on the toll roads. If you drive through the city on the main freeway with minimal traffic at the optimal time of day, it will still still cost you at least one hour of your life. That&#39;s not when we went. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nick made sure we arrived in the tail end of morning rush hour. We would make this trip every morning, Monday through Friday for a month. Alice had 2 weeks left. Today was my first trip, anywhere, ever. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I put the truck in 4th gear and slowly let out the clutch. The truck didn&rsquo;t move forward at all. Instead the engine coughed and halted. I&rsquo;d snubbed it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ha ha,&rdquo; Alice made her first contribution to the conversation. &ldquo;Good one, greenhorn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As I started the truck back up, Nick looked over at me and asked &ldquo;What gear are you in?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I tried 4th,&rdquo; I answered sheepishly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try 2nd.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;3rd would probably do,&rdquo; Nick offered, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t use 4th under a full load.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to the training trailer,&rdquo; I said easing out of the spot in 3rd. &ldquo;They teach us with empty trailers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get used to it. Just make sure you leave plenty of room to stop.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do we weigh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Usually about max, somewhere near 80k.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sheesh,&rdquo; I had trouble imagining what 80,000 pounds even looked like. &ldquo;What weighs 80 thousand pounds?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Some of that is the rig and trailer, the rest is paper.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lot of paper,&rdquo; I said pulling out onto the main road. &ldquo;I can really feel the difference, I wish we had something else.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he corrected me, &ldquo;no matter what you&rsquo;re carrying, they&rsquo;ll always try to get you near max weight. Anything less is a waste of money. What makes a difference is how it sits in the trailer. Some loads don&rsquo;t distribute so nice and it&rsquo;s hard to get the axles to balance out. Other times the weight can shift when you make a turn and get heavy on one side. You can&rsquo;t get in there to fix a sealed load so after a turn like that you&rsquo;re stuck with a lopsided turns for the rest of the drive. Paper sits in massive rolls, flat side down. It doesn&rsquo;t move and weighs the same, nose to doors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nick would go into great detail with any trucking question I had. You could tell he really knew a great deal about how this industry worked and enjoyed teaching it. The reason he chose this route was about to become painfully obvious. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This truck, like most models made in this decade, had 10 gears and required the driver to double clutch. The first 5 gears are for starting the truck from a dead stop. With a short empty trailer, you can slowly raise your foot off the clutch in 5th gear and pull forward. You can actually start in 7th if you&rsquo;re running bobtail: without any trailer at all. We were not. The most you could hope for was a start from 3rd. After just a few feet of travel in 3rd, you need to clutch out of gear, release the clutch, match the engine RPM to your speed and clutch back into the next gear. You could skip 4th and go right to fifth with a little practice. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Practice was the point of this exercise. Once we got to Chicago, we were stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic for over an hour before reaching our destination. That meant clutching into and out of every gear as we started and stopped the truck, over and over again. This physical effort is added on top of the already significant challenge of keeping your 8.5 foot wide truck inside the 10 foot lanes we&rsquo;d discover in the road construction zones while attempting to keep the right distance in front of your cab while people continuously cut you off. A lane change meant trying to squeeze you and your 53 foot trailer into the few car lengths of space you might be lucky to find next to you when you needed it. If it isn&rsquo;t there, you&rsquo;ll need to make it. As I learned to navigate this battlefield, Nick was quick with helpful tips about memorizing certain cars and how they were behaving around me. He showed me how to use this to my advantage when I needed that space to lane change or avoid reckless drivers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Pull over here,&rdquo; he pointed to a length of open curb at the end of some driveways next to a fire hydrant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I started to look for a spot to legally park further down the road when he yelled, &ldquo;NOW!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Right here!&rdquo; he was pointing specifically at the red curb next to us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh sure,&rdquo; I pulled over, &ldquo;I thought you meant where we could park.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;When I say you need to stop,&rdquo; He looked at me more seriously than ever before, I need to know you&rsquo;re going to stop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I nodded, &ldquo;of course - you got it. What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He seemed to accept that I was taking him seriously and turned his attention down the road. &ldquo;See that bridge ahead?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">There was a railroad bridge over a low spot in the road not far away. It had graffiti covered steel walls and rust streaks running down the heavy concrete supports on either end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&ldquo;Will we fit under that?&rdquo; Nick was waiting for me to guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How tall is it?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not marked,&rdquo; he let this sink in before he added, &ldquo;and we can&rsquo;t turn around or back up here. So what&rsquo;s your plan?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Everything he said was true. There were no indications on the bridge and the road we&rsquo;d just driven down was long and too narrow to turn this thing around. The one thing I could count on though, was that Nick had taken us here on purpose. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do we measure it?&rdquo; I shrugged, grasping for a solution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Alice snorted from the bunk in back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is a popular trucking route,&rdquo; Nick ignored her, &ldquo;just wait.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It wasn&rsquo;t long before a truck came rolling past from the other direction. There wasn&rsquo;t much daylight above his trailer as he squeaked under the bridge - but it was clearly tall enough for us. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Neat trick,&rdquo; I nodded and reached for the shifter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Take a break,&rdquo; NIck smiled and slammed his heavy palm on the oversized air brake button on the dash. Air rushed out of the brake system locking all 18 wheels in place. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re up, smart ass,&rdquo; he called back to Alice who seemed to already know it was her turn. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Alice and I swapped places and slid under the low rail bridge. We turned and followed the tracks to the BNSF Corwith Intermodal Rail Yard. This facility receives freight by truck or rail, stores it and transfers it to other rails or trucks all day and night 7 days a week. Thankfully Alice had done this before, but Nick was still watching her and everything around us like a hawk. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Entire semi trailers were being lifted in the air over our heads and placed on waiting trains. Short hydraulic lift tractors Nick referred to as &ldquo;yard-dogs&rdquo; whipped around us pulling loaded and empty trailers to new locations on the lot. Everyone seemed to know exactly what they were doing, and anyone who didn&rsquo;t was an obstacle to honk at and drive rapidly around. Alice backed confidently into a space in the overflow yard and hopped out to unhook our trailer. I was watching all of this with more than curiosity. I had a definite vested interest since I figured that this would be my job tomorrow. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
