The building had been converted from an old factory and still had a lot of old beams and cool architectural details. A few blocks away, there was a reasonably safe spot where I could park my truck overnight without worry about getting a ticket. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Despite the area being well lit and visible, I didn&rsquo;t quite feel safe enough to keep it running to stay warm. So every morning, I&rsquo;d have to get up an extra hour early to get the motor started. In the summer months, you could just hop in and turn the key like any other vehicle. But since this was winter in St. Paul, it could take a few tries. Once it was running, I&rsquo;d let it idle for another 30 minutes on really cold days before going to fetch my first load. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The loads on this local route, always came from the same place. The pickup location was a BNSF Midway railyard in Minneapolis, a bit smaller than the one I&rsquo;d first seen in Chicago. I&rsquo;d arrive bobtail, snag an empty chassis or ready trailer and head out to make a local delivery. If the runs were short, it was possible to do this 3 times a day. There wasn&rsquo;t a whole lot of mileage in it, so the pay scale was a bit different. Not that I took this route for the money, of course. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the weeks went on, I got pretty familiar with this deal. But the days were getting shorter and colder, and my truck was not happy. At least once a week, I&rsquo;d find my pull handle was sticking. On the coldest mornings, my rig would refuse to cooperate altogether. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uuugh.&rdquo; I rolled over as Michelle turned off the alarm clock. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still dark out. How can it be morning already?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;m tired of dark cold mornings,&rdquo; she wrapped a blanket over he shoulders and went downstairs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was not much of a morning person, but Michelle was pretty good at it. By the time I got out of the shower, she was already coming back in from walking her little dog Casey. Casey was a sharp-looking white West-Highland Terrier. He was well trained, and just getting used to me. He shook himself vigorously as he scrambled into the apartment ahead of Michelle. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jesus Christ it&rsquo;s cold out there!&rdquo; She said, tossing her mittens on the counter. &ldquo;Are you sure you have to work today?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t get temperature holidays,&rdquo; I laughed and laced up my boots. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well take something warm with you,&rdquo; she said hanging up her jacket, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s freezing out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We got any coffee?&rdquo; I asked, thinking we didn&rsquo;t. Michelle wasn&rsquo;t a fan. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; She smiled and put some water on the stove. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I bought some when I was out shopping,&rdquo; she took a can of instant mix out of the cabinet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just instant, is that OK?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the best!&rdquo; I smiled and finished getting ready.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The coffee was too hot to drink on the way to my truck, but the hot cup felt good between my hands. I set the mug down on the dashboard, took a deep breath and turned the key. The engine wheezed and grumbled, but it was not about to start. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I hopped down from my seat and went for a can of starter fluid from the side compartment. The compartment door was frozen shut and took a bit of banging to force it open. Once inside I received a can of ether to help the starter. I blasted 2 long sprays into the air intake of my truck and jumped back in the seat. The highly flammable mist was just enough to push trick the engine into starting. I gave it a touch of gas to get it going and reached for my coffee. The cup was ice cold. There was actual ice around the top of my cup. I opened my door and poured the remaining liquid onto the parking lot. I&rsquo;m sure it was ice before I pulled out onto the road.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My first run that morning was headed to a department store about 45 miles from where I picked up the load. I hooked up the air and electric lines and double checked the pull handle - it was stuck again. I pushed it back into position, stomped the snow off my boots and hopped back in my rig. The engine reluctantly pulled out onto the road and shuddered all the way to the highway. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was hoping that once I got it up to freeway speed it would finally get warm enough to stop complaining. But it didn&rsquo;t. It just kept getting worse. By the time I reached my destination my top speed was about 40 mph. Another load was assigned to me when I made my delivery, but I had to decline it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I told my dispatcher about the temperature and how the engine was handling and he sent me to a nearby truck repair center. The mechanic there informed me that the heads were warped, and it would be a few hours. I asked him to check the pull handle and he shrugged and said it &ldquo;seemed fine&rdquo;. I spent the rest of the day in the waiting room watching cable on a crappy wall mounted television. This was before smartphones or uber. I could&rsquo;ve paid for a taxi to get home, and then another to come back later but that would&rsquo;ve just been a pointless waste of money. Enough money was already being wasted today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where have you been parking your truck at night?&rdquo; my dispatcher wanted to know later that week. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a secure lot just 2 blocks from here,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you leave it running?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s a good idea.&rdquo; I wanted to keep parking there though, so I added, &ldquo;I mean, it&rsquo;s well lit and fenced in - I just feel weird leaving it running when I&rsquo;m not in it, you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, I get that.&rdquo; He sounded satisfied but had a better idea, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another route I&rsquo;d like to put you on. It&rsquo;s still local, but I want you to park at the relay site.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, no more rail yards?&rdquo; This could be an improvement, I thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No more rail yards, it&rsquo;s a dedicated run to Wisconsin and back. You&rsquo;ll do a ride along on Monday to see how it works. What do you think?&rdquo; He was trying to sound like it was my choice, but it probably wasn&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The only issue I had with this arrangement was the parking. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s this relay station?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Schneider lot in North St. Paul, they&rsquo;ve got power so you can leave your tractor plugged in at night.&rdquo; He was getting to the real reason for this new assignment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need to work something out with my girlfriend,&rdquo; driving to a driving job seemed kind of silly but I offered, &ldquo;maybe I can use her car.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let me know by the end of the day, training is on Monday,&rdquo; he reiterated before we hung up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Michelle was actually pretty cool with me using her car. I&rsquo;d drive her to her job at the Hennepin County Government Center in the morning, and pick her up on my way home. Her car would sit at the Schneider lot during the day, and my truck could stay there during the night. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Monday&rsquo;s training session was interesting, to say the least.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
