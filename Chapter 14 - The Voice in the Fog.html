The still night air had cooled considerably and a thick heavy fog fell over the freeway. Stopping was not an option, I had too far to go yet tonight to just call it quits. I resigned myself to simply put on my 4 ways, drive slow, and keep myself awake listening to the cb radio.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I never did upgrade my lights,&rdquo; a driver was saying, &ldquo;do you think it&rsquo;s worth it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lemme tell ya,&rdquo; an authoritative voice came over the air waves, &ldquo;I can tell you exactly what you get for your money.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His voice sounded as though he should be doing commercials for the Marines or something.
